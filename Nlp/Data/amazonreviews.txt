__label__1 Dangerous Product!!!: I purchased the Vtech 2421 as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. It worked for 3 days and then stopped. She then let it charge for 24 hours before attempting to use it again and when she tried, it was so overheated the handset just about burned her hand! I returned the product. Only wish there was a 0-star rating.
__label__1 Very boring !: "Succubus" is incoherent, confusing, and, above all, very very boring. I mean i like weird, surreal movies, movies when it's very hard for the viewer to separate the reality from the dream, but this movie sucks big time!!And even though i thought it will be at least a horror movie, well i was wrong! In fact "Succubus" is NOT a horror movie at all.My advice is: Avoid this at all coasts!!!! Only recommended for those who suffer from insomnia!!!!
__label__2 A Terrific First Novel!: THE FIXER marks an impressive debut from this Boston author. Vampires, spies, lust, it's got a bit of everything! The writing is smooth and fluid, so it makes for a very satisfying read. This book is a fun ride, and I can't wait til the next installment is published. I'm a forever fan!
__label__2 so educational and yet fun: the crusin world game is so fun because you get 2 c different places while your still sitting on the floor playing a video game.u get 2 c places and like monuments and the kind of terrean they have in that country or city or continent.i think it is better than the other crusisn usa because it has many different choices of cars. and you can choose the place you want to play in.
__label__1 This broke immediately: Very cute but unfortunately it is cheaply made. The handle broke immediately. Be aware that it is very tiny too.
__label__1 Won't Install With Roxio Media Creator: When I tried to install this software it got part way through the process and then briefly displayed an error box and automatically started an uninstall without waiting long enough for me to read the error. Upon completion of the uninstall I no longer had access to any of my CD or DVD drives. It appeares that it corrupted the drivers. I had to restore my hard drive to get back into full operation. Pinnacle's response was that I should uninstall all picture editing software, in particular, Roxio Media Creator. I have since upgraded to Adobe Photoshop Elements 4 and added Adobe Premiere Elements 2, neither of which have a conflict with the Roxio software.
__label__1 Cool baby daddy poetry--where are the blood and guts?: The poetry is clean, no doubt, and the poet is talented, but I couldn't help but ask the question, "Who cares?" When it was light, it was ticklish and not moving, and I never found it dark. Slick, yes--the book was slick, too slick. It must've been a slow year for the Bakeless Prize, for this manuscript to have won it. It seems that, if the author were to focus on the depth of his humor, and on the depth of his "intellectual statement," future efforts might exceed this one considerably--for, again, I repeat that he IS talented. Right now, though, he is irrelevant.
__label__2 Great: Works well with my 4G sansa clip. USB connector is a little loose, but does not seem to be a problem.
__label__2 easy to use and dependable: we use lexmark x4270 at 5 out of 6 of our small business workstations and have very little problems with them. they are easy to install into your computer and come with a one year warranty, which lexmark does honor. it's a win-win
__label__1 sound block review: First of all, the product does not include the battery and it is hard to put the battery in. After all the effort, it refuses to give even the slightest hint of a sound. Not sure if it is a design flaw or we just happened to have a bad product.
__label__2 Fascinating, maddening read: This book covers much of the political situation for the last six years. It will madden, disgust the reader, but enlighten , too. I was only disappointed that the authors didn't seem to have any real suggestions to Crash the Gate.However since the book was published before the 2006 elections, it appears that much was successful in that task. It explains, too why the Democratic party in DC was unhappy about the final results of that election. But we are happy, though.
__label__1 Save Your Money: Utterly disappointing. No more than two or three good songs. The rest are just boring or dumb. Absolutely nothing original on this CD. Doesn't even come close to matching their first CD.
__label__2 Banker to the Poor: This book gives hope for the very poor whether in the U.S. or in refuge camps in Africa!
__label__1 Ugh! Waste of 3 bucks!: Armand Assante must have been DESPERATE for money or something when he agreed to star in this film. He's the only actor who can actually act. Everyone else in the film just kind of stands there and reads lines. It is soooo bad. Don't wase your money! I can't believe some people actually LIKE this movie! Terrible peice of you-know-what!
__label__2 Fits to Camry 92 - 96: It definitely fits to Camrys 92 - 96, at least it works fine for my two Camrys 95 V6 and 96 V6. The only disadvantage is that old cap doesn't fit this reservoir, so you'll have to replace the cap too. It is included, but it doesn't have overflow safety tube (that spills out coolant if overflown).Another minor issue - no "low" and "full" marks.Other that this it is a direct OEM fit. Good bang for the buck, OEM reservoir costs $100+.
__label__2 who's macon?: In two earlier books in this series, Savannah only has one brother, Waycliff and in Sugar and Spite, Macon was her father that she rarely saw growing up. When was Macon introduced as a younger brother? I really love these books, but this question was bothering me. Also, when did chief Bloss (or captain or whatever) disappear or appear and it turned into Hillquist and Jefferies?
__label__1 What the?: I'm sorry, maybe it's just me but I can't helping stating that this has to be one of the wrost movies I've seen in my life!Can you say boring? Can you say doesn't make sense at all? The first 30 minutes of the movie were O.K. But it went downhill after that. This movie is a prime example of a director attempting to make a deep movie with a meaningful lesson but failed on all levels. I don't recommend this movie unless you want to go to sleep or you don't have anything else to do.
__label__2 Dyson Tool: The tool works great, I would reorder from this company again. It arrived on time and I was very pleased with the order.
__label__2 Gwa...It continues.: Good...yet...neh...I really don't know what to say.Okay, well, it is a good continuation to the wonderful series, but I mainly got this for the pencil boards. (I luv Tasuki!)I like Fushigi Yuugi, but it does drag from time to time (well, a lot of the time) and you really have to stomache getting to this part in the series. I nearly stopped when my favorite character died in the series.I suppose I can say...this series is slightly complicated and twisted in its own ways. [Twisted is good.]This ova kinda contridicts my view of how it should be, but hey I accept all versions of how it could be.Oh, yeah...this ova will make NO sense whatsoever if you haven't watched the TV series (all 52 episodes), the first OVA (3 episodes), and the 2nd OVA (6 episodes--I believe; I don't own that yet).So, as most of my favorite animes, this one is lengthy and you have to be willing to stick with it.
__label__2 Englebert Humperdinck: Public Enemy No. 19: What an incredible surprise "Love is the Reason" is! This album--an Englebert Humperdinck essential--is, hands down, the most revolutionary of adult contemporary releases by any artist. Never have I been more shocked and, strangely, enlightened by such a cynical and misanthropist recording by the usually happy-go-lucky Humperdinck. As the album title suggests, love really IS the reason! But not the reason for what you might expect; although Humperdinck's songs are obstensibly very light, the listener senses a bit of sarcasm that makes you wonder if good ol' Humpy isn't hitting the bottle a little more often these days (remember the 70s!?). A truly terrific buy from an extraordinarily gifted artist!!
__label__2 Fantastic Series: To me, not quite as good as Season 1 but still wonderful.The acting is superb. Every character comes alive and the viewer shares in the joys and sorrows of each
__label__2 If you don't have this, buy it: Alec Baldwin is tied with John Goodman for the second highest appearing host of all time. So it's only natural that he now has a best of DVD. This is not the best SNL DVD, but it is still a VERY good one. If you already have the best of Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks... get this one next. This DVD has a couple of not-so-good skits, but it makes up for every one. There are a lot of hilarious skits on the DVD. I'm not going to list them, but just trust me. Anyone who gives this less than four stars is OUT OF THEIR MIND. When I first saw that the Best of Alec Baldwin was out I didn;t have to give it a second thought. It was at the top of my list, and it should be at the top of yours too.
__label__1 It's not sweet, nor is it love.: Two words : rape myths. I didn't expect a classic, but this was pure rot. Steve, the "hero", is lucky he existed a long time ago; in this day and age he'd get a life sentence. Of course, Ginny the ninny would probably send him care packages in jail - women love the men who rape them, according to Ms. Rogers
__label__1 Did Not Perform Well: I was so excited to find such a great deal on D batteries, especially on the Duracell brand, but they have not performed well. I bought them solely to use in my baby swing, but they only last 2 weeks in there. Compared to Rayovac and Duracell Coppertop that's half as long, as these other two will last me a month. I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__1 too expensive for what you get.: This product provides just 10 feet of track and a car for $30 dollars. It should cost $5. Do not buy, as it is simply too expensive. $30 should get at least 100 feet of track.
__label__1 Who's "In"? Who cares.: John Fairchild is the charismatic and outspoken publisher of two of the fashion industry's most influential magazines: Women's Wear Daily and W. Here he offers the ultimate insider's guide to today's fashion scene--a gossipy, no-holds-barred look at the world of the superstar designers and social climbers who buy their clothes. It's actually a pretty boring book. It was written in the 80's so it's really dated. I wouldn't recommend this one, it's way too pretentious.
__label__2 HEY MUSIC LISTENERS...EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS THE EASY WAY!!: IF YOU'RE FEELING LIKE IT'S TIME TO EXPAND YOUR MUSICAL HORIZONS, THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START. THERE'S PLENTY OF GOOD BEATS AND CATCHY MELODIES THAT WILL KEEP YOUR TOES TAPPING AND YOU'LL CATCH YOURSELF HUMMING THE TUNES WHILE YOU WORK. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF WANTING TO BUY SOME CLASSICAL MUSIC (GASP...). I'VE BEEN A HARD ROCK/HEAVY METAL MUSICIAN FOR YEARS WITH A DEFINITE TASTE FOR CLASSICAL INFLUENCE OVER THE BLUES, SO VANESSA IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY!! ALSO, VANESSA IF YOUR READING THIS, NEXT TIME YOUR IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA, PLEASE COME BY THE BUILDING MY FAMILY OWNS WHERE ZETA MUSIC IS CRANKING OUT THE VIOLINS THAT YOU DO SUCH JUSTICE TO!!
__label__1 Not worth your time: The back cover and introduction hooked me while in the bookstore, so I picked up a copy and was disappointed to find that there wasn't much else to the book. As many reviewers have pointed out, it does stroke the ego of the loner, but I found it be more a manifest list of who may have been a loner than anything else. I've been a loner all my life; recently I've been pondering moving in with a girlfriend, but due to my reluctance to give up my "space", I picked up the book hoping to learn more about how other loners interact with people. Other than a few interesting but meaningless insights (such as corporations market to those who will tell their friends, not those who won't), there wasn't much, beyond hearing how non-loners just don't understand. Not a book I'd recommend to anyone.
__label__1 Doesn't Smell Right!!: I am sending this back, it does not smell like the perfume that I currently have had in the past. Very disapointed.
__label__1 Magna Bug Stinks: I bought 2 of these for my 2 sons (ages 5 & 7) for Christmas this year. Both boys LOVE bugs. They both thought these looked pretty cool in the box. They both lost interest VERY quickly. My 7 year summed it up, "This isn't much of a toy." 'Nuf said.
__label__1 Trashcan: This phone has a short and non-replaceble handset cord. It has a short and non-replaceable line cord. It lasted less than a day.Line cord was damaged after purchase. It went into the trash.
__label__2 It was Great, educational: I'm 9 and I loved it. Intriguing, a young south sea trader on a unpopular sea atoll finds love and happiness there.
__label__2 Blood Pressure Monitor: MF-81 blood pressure monitor is very easy to use and seems to be accurate. Have not compared it with the doctor's readings but I am happy with it.
__label__2 I think it is a good book.: I identify myself with the BSC, I have read most of the books and some people think this books are stupid but that's because they don't appreciate Ann Martin's writing. I liked the trama of this book because it was fun and interesting. My favorite Babysitters are Maryanne and Stacey.
__label__2 Squeezes many Limes and Lemons: As a regular visitor to the tropics, I have purchased a variety of lemon squeezers. Most of them have been toys as opposed to kitchen tools. The OXO is a pleasant change. It does the job well, cleans with no problems and is sturdy enough that it will serve me well for years.
__label__1 Too Many Gaps: The author clearly does not understand heterosexual love and/or heterosexual sexuality, and skips over too many important details, specifically, why the grandmother and her gay husband conceived a child.
__label__1 The Thomas Beryman Number: I was suppose to get a new paperback. I got a paperback with water damage and very smelly. I threw it away.
__label__2 Very good product: I bought this product based on the reviews I've read. It's easy to assemble and fold. At first, we used the divider for our golden retriever puppy when she was 10 to 12 weeks old. But she's gotten a little bigger and thought she needed more space to be able to stretch inside, so we removed the divider and put in a fleece bed for her. She sometimes gnaws on the bars but still no damage.
__label__2 Great short-cut!: I learn all the basics from it. It should be a book for all levels. I am now reading my own personality and fortune - with wonderful accuracy!
__label__1 Worst Move I've EVER seen!!!: The only place this movie belongs is in the incinerator!! There was absolutely no story here...some numbskull got roped into videotaping the party they were having and WOW aliens dropped out of the sky and everyone is running around like idiots! No real story line at all. Had the creators thought enough to put `real' characters to the movie and create a real sci-fi story it might have been salvageable!! I'm a real Sci-Fi lover but this doesn't even come close to real science fiction it runs more in line with something that popped off the TV back in the 1940's! Stupid with no story line at all!! Waste of money and time! I would have given it a NO STAR RATING if I could have!
__label__1 NOT ORIGINAL RECORDING MIX! SINKS THIS OK HITS SET!: It's hard to trash this CD, but the original mix of these songs is so much better I can not recommend it! Just listen to "I'm Eighteen" on the album CD and then listen to this version on the hits and it says it all! The Harmonica is buried on the hits disc and it destroys the dynamics of the entire track! The whole album sounds like it is one flat level with no dynamic range what so ever! It is also missing too many great songs. Do yourself a favor and save your bucks and buy a few of his albums instead.....it will be well worth it!
__label__1 Jeff Dunham Show--Not Up To His Standards: What a mistake. Obviously, the TV show didn't get past the initial season. The segments in the show just don't work. Not even comparable to his on-stage shows. They try to incorporate the characters into real-life situations, but not very well. The interaction seems rushed and stilted.It was a disappointment.
__label__2 It Was A Good Story: I have read several of Nora Roberts' books and enjoyed most of them. This one was good, I wanted to finish reading it so Icould find out how it was going to end but, something was missing. I never was able to put my finger on what Iwanted to read that I was not reading. I got real confused when Stella started showing up in places other than Seth'sdreams. I thought I was reading the text incorrectly. Then, I was realized what the author had done with thecharacter.It's a good book but I don't think I will be reading it again. I'm glad I checked it out of our local library and did notpay money for it.
__label__2 Easy to Use, Bright Colors: The tablets are simple for a kid to use- just drop one or two in to create the color and the tablets rapidly dissolve. The colors are nice and bright, even in a deep bath. They seem to be mild on the skin, but a long soak can actually create a little color on the skin, particularly if you use two or more tablets. The Instructions state that you can use up to four at a time. If they stain the skin slightly, use a sprayer to take the color off or wipe it away with a wet cloth. It does come off easily. The only real downside is that there are few colors to choose from. You can create more colors by mixing two together, but I would have preferred a few more colors so that you don't have to add so many tablets to the bath. Overall, a great product and lots of fun for kids.
__label__1 Makes a good paper weight: I have had two of these out for a couple of weeks, rebated several times with new peanut butter and have had no luck. Caught one in the old snap trap so I do not recommend these.
__label__1 Product Failed During First Use: Just as other purchasers have warned, this chip failed after taking about 250 pictures while I was on vacation. The chip froze up and the camera won't function with it, nor can I download the pictures. There is a manufacturer's flaw in this product. I have now purchased another brand. Don't use this chip for a camera or you will lose your pictures. I wish that I could get a refund rather than a replacement chip on the warranty.
__label__1 Oh Please!: First of all, the lady should not go around declaring that she is the first asian singer to sing R&B. (It's more like a tacky version of R&B-pop) Nor should she go around (for she did in Asia) saying that she hopes the Grammy committee will consider her as a nominee (God forbid).The songs lack soul, although she has a nice voice. Most of her songs lack substance, and she trys to be hip and everything but fails (plus she even has two songs with almost the same title!). I have no idea why Kelly Price would want to guest on this CD...Coco Lee can do much better than this. She had better, if she ever wants to be considered a world-class singer. Disappointing. Don't know what the hype has been about.
__label__1 Scratch and Solve Hangman? I THINK NOT!: This was absolutely horrendous! Why buy this overpriced defective puzzlebook when you could buy something that actually works? The scratch off seals don't work. We tried a penny, a quarter, and our fingernails, and nothing worked. How hard could it be to make a scratch-off seal that actually scratches off? The people at the lottery have no problem doing it. Eventually, after my aunt and I tried just about every material known to man, the last thing that we tried was a metal nail file, and that still wasn't entirely successful-- it was extremely difficult to make even that work. This little tiny book cost $6.00! And it doesn't even work right! Why in the world would you spend $6.00 on a hangman game that doesn't even work? You could spend your money much more wisely. You can buy tons of stuff for $6.00. I absolutely loathe this game. I am taking it back. The only possible use for this book is as a firestarter. I hope you don't buy this game.
__label__2 Garmin StreetPilot c320 GPS Vehicle Navigator: One of the best items I have ever purchased. There is no way you can get lost with this thing! I loaded the whole US and Canada on a 2 gig sd with 1 gig left over.
__label__1 Flex plate failure: I am running a Hays #12-040 on a Jegs 351W crate engine. I have ran 302 miles with about 20 starts on the engine. There are 7 teeth broken off of the starter ring. The plate does not seem to line up so that it uses the entire surface of the starter teeth. I guess I will look for an OEM and see if it will perform any better.
__label__1 It's Ok, but it doesn't take great pictures: I've had this camera for 6 months now. I like the waterproof aspect since I can take it boating or to the beach and not have to worry. My first battery failed within a week of getting the camera and it was a hassle getting a replacement battery from the company.But, I think it just doesn't take very good pictures. At least 25% of the pictures I took on vacation this summer turned out blurry or out of focus, no matter what setting I put it on. It's also very slow to capture the picture, so I frequently miss shots. Finally, the flash doesn't reach very far, so anything I try to take in dim light doesn't come out very well.I had the Pentax 43WR for a few years and loved it, so when it was time to upgrade, this seemed like the ideal camera to purchase. I'll be getting a new camera soon, which is a shame since I've had this one such a short time, but I just don't think it's a very good camera.
__label__1 Same old, same old: What a disappointment. As an experienced teacher, I should've been more careful. There are NO examples, no new stories, nothing original or new. The same graphic organizers we have all seen. Save your money and buy something else. From now on, I think I will preview at the bookstore before I purchase through internet.
__label__1 QC is terrible.: I can't comment how it actually sharpens because I was never able to use it. The first one I received had a broken handle which was promptly returned for replacement. Second one had a severe curve to the sharpening surface. I was willing to try for a third but Amazon's policy on replacements revented it so I settled for a refund.
__label__2 The very Best of David Whitfield: It is agreat pity this CD and other DW recordings are out of print. However they seem to be reprinted from time to time so it might be worth checking with Amazon. This CD might also have an alternative title - 'David Whitfield's Greatest Hits' - Also look for other titles - 'The World of David Whitfield' - 'From David with Love' 28 tracks of popular classics - 'David Whitfield Sings Stage & Screen Favourites'. Amazon also have a book on David Whitfield - 'Cara Mia' - a MUST for anyone interested in finding out more about him.
__label__1 Vanity Publication: The photographs are excellent, but no better than 100 other similar books that constantly come out, and with no real creative flair. The text is unworthy of mention, void of insights into the really interesting aspects of White House life. Really, this would have been a second-rate magazine article. The reason for this book even to exist is hard to imagine, except Hillary and a publisher trying to capitalize on her political popularity. This is better than Jimmy Stewart's poetry, but not much.I have to admit, the good photographs would have rated an extra star, just as a coffee table book, if this weren't such an artifice. Hillary Clinton is not Jackie Kennedy and she is not Martha Stewart. She should stick to things where her interest and her talent are more credible, such as important social topics.
__label__1 Waste of time: I am a voracious reader of historical fiction as a conquence seldom remember title or authors names. I will remember Ms Young's so that I do not ever read her again. The book drags, discriptions are tedious and it is overly violent with graphic descriptions. Thankfully, I got this book from a public library. I stopped at page 72 of a 475 page book.
__label__1 Junk: This item is a piece of junk. It has already boken and can't hold a a small strip of leather. I bought 6 of them as gifts and now can't use them. I am returning them.
__label__1 doesnt work: you gotta moniter this kit frequently, i left mine alone for about a month and when i next checked on it the dirt was peeling up and all the blue rocks and plastic reptiles were in a corner. This piece of junk isnt growing even after like 4 months.
__label__2 This Could Be You: There could be a Cobra or a Viper, a StingRay or even a Ferrari or a Lincoln Continental in a barn near you. Or, perhaps more likely, in a barn at the end of a rainbow somewhere. You probably won't find a Bugatti or an S-Type Invicta, but the many lucky car hunters, and at least a couple of pretty good writers, who contributed to this book have found interesting, buyable, restorable cars in barns, gardens and fields. Their stories are page-turners; their secrets: patience, plenty of travel, winning phone skills, and eyes and ears wide open at all times.Whether you hunt for rare cars, hope to stumble upon them serendipitously, or just dream of doing so, you will enjoy "The Cobra in the Barn," Highly recommended.The correct spelling is Duesenberg, despite being spelled a couple of different ways in the book.
__label__1 resolution lacking: Most pictures are too out of focus to use, but every once in a while you get something really clear.Had lots of trouble getting it to work with out computer since it didn't come with instructions, we downloaded a driver from the company website that unnecessarily blocked the auto config. process. Very tough to press buttons when using waterproof casing.
__label__2 This is Acid jazz CD: I originally purchased this CD becasue of one song I had been searching for, but found serveral songs to add to my music playlist. Good find.
__label__2 Dremel 220-01 Rotary Tool Work Station: I am very pleased with this press.It is not designed for 'ultra' precision drilling but works excellent for my needs.I think it's a great product for the price.
__label__2 Son Loves it: My son gave me the money to buy this 1-6 set. He always got into mine and finally he had me order him his own set. He is now lacking the 7th (last book) and it has to be paperback to go w/ the rest of his collection. But anyways, I highly recommend this and all Harry Potter Books and Movies. You will get lost in the book and feel like your actually playing the parts of the character's.
__label__1 This system is weak and did not protect my computer and i dont think it will protect you: This isnt a very good thing to buy. It says it looks after your computer and deletes spyware and such. This program is ok but it is not the best. It turns out Spyware Killer doesnt spot all of the SpyWare that may be on your computer.It also does not do a very good job deleting the program. I'll give you a example. I spotted a small amount of spyware on my computer and i deleted it or so i thought. I scanned the next day and all of the spware i deleted came back. It isnt very useful also because you have to scan every ten minutes or the spware comes right back.It also does not prevent snooping by tracking spyware, detecting it and removing it before it infects your PC. So please save your time and do not buy this please.
__label__2 A Must Have For Any Collection: This is one of my favorites, Christian and secular! Excellent compositions with oustanding, spiritual lyrics. A must buy!!
__label__2 Best Musical ever: I already have it on regular DVD but I got it on Blue Ray and what a great difference it is.I think (in my opinion) that this is the very best musical and story line ever.All of the cast fit their parts perfect and the actual music fits the story. Everything comes together and on Blue Ray it could not be better.
__label__1 DOES NOT support Smart Media Cards: Advertised as supporting Smart Media cards. It does NOT. Don't buy this if you are looking for a reader for smart media cards. Very disappointing!
__label__2 great product, takes a while to get used to using it...: very easy to use but it does take a little while to get used to using a mandolin slicer if you have not used one before...be patient, it is worth it...very sharp, precise cuts and comes with a safety storage box that doubles as drip-dry container for the pieces after you rinse them off...I use a cut-resistant glove along with the hand guard that comes with the slicer...don't take a chance, the blades are super sharp...
__label__1 Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad.......: If you compare it to all the garbage that is always being played on the radio or eMpTyV, this album is not that bad. But if you compare it to the work that this band did in the 80's, this is absolute trash!!! Long gone are the days in which MetallicA was one of the top 5 music acts in the world. It's very, very sad... :(
__label__2 Epyon is finally here!!!: It's about time. In this set of three episodes the Gundam Epyon is finally revealed. Also, Duo reappears in this episode, as well as Zechs with the Tallgeese. Heero and Relena have fairly big parts in these episodes, and the plot sets up for important things to come. So, if you have been a fan of the series, this video is a must have.
__label__2 This book is my Bible!: I have been a panic attack/IBS sufferer all my life but moreso in the past 8 months. This book changed my life and outlook regarding my well-being. And it's wonderfully written from someone who experienced Anxiety. Whenever I feel myself getting anxious, I just flip to the pages that I have all marked as significant in banishing my anticipatory thoughts and am instantly brought back down to Earth. This book is a must-have for panic attack sufferers.
__label__1 Died quickly: With this battery you get what you paid for. It died within 6 months. No short cuts, if your phones battery goes dead, just get another phone, good batteries cost almost as much as the phone and cheap batteries like this one aren't worth the trouble.
__label__1 Terrible Quality: Received this model 66 Oldsmobile Toronado today. The packaging and box were in good shape. However, the actual car is very poorly built. The paint is uneven and the doors fall off when I try to open them. Guess that this company has no quality control; total mockery of this iconic car. The bottom of this car is almost like a cheap toy; probably could have gotten better quality and detail from a match box car. I would not buy anoother model car from this company.
__label__2 LOVE this flatware!!: I was tired of our old stainless steel flatware that was dull and worn. I fell in love with the pattern online and wasn't disappointed when it showed up. It's a classic pattern that won't go out of style, it's shiny and elegant but simple enough for everyday use. I like the distinct differnce between the place fork and salad fork. And don't know how I got by previously without all the extra teaspoons. We've only had it a month but I love it and know it'll last forever.
__label__1 Too soft for watch stem cutting: I really hoped these pliers could handle cutting down the stem of the ETA/Unitas 6497-1. Unfortunately, it seems the stem is too thick and too strong for this little tool. Each time I made a cut it dented the blade.Stem cutting is a slow process of trim-fit-repeat until the crown is flush with the case. now this tool has a serrated edge. According to Otto Frei website, The Lindstrom brand is highly regarded amongst professional watchmakers. But those retail at around $40! I'm wondering if Klein tools is good, also. I guess I'm going to have to get one of those the next time I put together another watch in a few years.
__label__1 Too short: These movies are way too short they should have put it all on one disk. The majority of each movie is for the parents. It would be better if one movie was for the kids and one movie for parents. Its a bit boring by the time my child gets interested in it its over.
__label__2 Very Nice: Quite an entertaining futurama story that further explains some things about the series, and has a lot of fun jumping through time while doing so.
__label__1 Heating element melted through plastic: I have a 1500 gallon koi pond next to my house. I used this heater the first year for about 4-5 months with no problems. The second year, the heating element inside melted through the plastic and allowed water to fill the inside making it sink to the bottom of the pond.
__label__1 The Book Sucks: This books was not helpful at all. I was so confused that I actually had to drop the course.
__label__2 pelle the conqueror: The movie was one of deep trust between a father and son during hard times. Thhe dreams of one child was able to get them through and to their dreams. A moving and very touching film with believable characters.
__label__1 A DISAPPOINTMENT!: This book is so very out-dated. The majority of the quilts, coverlets and afghans are borderline silly looking by todays standards of excellence.....and even past standards. However, there are a few examples of fine work. Wouldn't spend money on it again. Not for my library.
__label__1 A MOVE MADE BY PSYCHOPATHS - FOR PSYCHOPATHS: When did horror movies become movies where people just get tortured slowly? When did seeing people get tortured slowly become entertainment? Why is it okay for a movie like this to be made?This is a movie made by psychopaths - I mean that literally. The people responsible for making this movie are losers, people who contribute nothing to society except to make this world a worse place to live. I find it disgusting that movies like this exist, and that there are people entertained by movies like this. This isn't meant to be a joke or to be facetious - if you like this movie, do the world a favor and kill yourself. I am absolutely not kidding about that. This is a movie made by psychopaths - for psychopaths, and if you like this movie - there's no room in the world for loser scum like you.
__label__1 Waste of money: Used for two days, and like everyone said.. Keyboard has a repeat problem eventhough the reciever is RIGHT near it, with brand new batteries. The mouse feels not so comfy and middle button clicking is very hard.I've used the same mouse before, but I did not know it was this exact mouse, untill I bought it. Horrific mouse, and keyboard doesn't work when typing fast. Read other online reviews from other place than Amazon to see its unusefulness.I've stopped using after 2 days. Keyboard problem exists when using USB or P2 port. Mouse has its engineering problem.
__label__1 BAD PICTURE: THE PICTURE OF THE RUSSELS SHORTS APPEAR TO BE ABOVE THE KNEE IN LENGTH. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THEY ARE TO THE KNEE AND SOME WHAT BELOW. NOT WHAT THE PICTURES SHOWS.
__label__1 Did not work for me: maybe it was the version, but this did not work on the graffiti that was on my glass window... The graffiti might be acid type ink...
__label__1 Not happy with the bass: This stereo would be great if it wasn't for the fact that the bass is far too much and can't be turned down.
__label__1 Awkwardly not for kids.: It would be nice if this was labeled that it is intended for adults. I was dissapointed that I could not watch this with my kids. The swearing seems out of place...almost as if it was forced. The animation is dated, but I think still good for a T.V. show.
__label__2 like it!: My son and his 12 year old friends find this pool table to be a lot of fun....they move it easily from inside to the outside deck...because it is free standing and table height-its fun to use and play....
__label__2 A biased, but essential analysis of American history: This book is a must read. A lot of his points are true, and a lot are radical leftist rhetoric. The fact of the matter is we need this kind of information. Sweeping our past and present wrongdoings (internment camps, racism, sexism, etc) under the carpet is an egregious act to commit. Zinn exposes many of these wrongs that are not told in conventional history books. This should not be the only history book you read, it is something that should be read after reading any run-of-the mill high school history text. Even if you disagree with most of Zinn's points you must agree that we are lucky to live in a country that allows freedom of press, without that right great men like Zinn would never be heard
__label__2 love at second time of trying: A happy manThe first day of wearing the hush puppies I found them a bit stiff,I Thought oh no I have scuffed the soles and now I am committedTo the ownership of these shoes . However from the second dayon they are proofing to be exactly what I expected from this brandof (hush puppy) shoe. Again I am a happy man
__label__1 Be Cautious: This is the consumer version of the Nautilus Treadclimber. It's smaller than the Nautilus machine but otherwise very similar.24 Hour Fitness gyms bought a bunch of these a few years back and introduced them with great fanfare.The good news - excellent workout. Far better than treadmills or ellipticals in my experience.The bad news - they were all recalled after most wore out.Nautilus introduced a new improved version. Again - excellent workout. Sadly, again, most wore out.Hopefully someday Nautilus/Bowflex will solve all the problems and release a version 3 that lasts. Till then, given the "no labor" and the short hydraulic warranty I'd be very cautious about purchasing one.
__label__1 If you see Ian Halperin: Tell him he is a hack. This fair tale of facts has nothing to do with the story. Iam Halperin is an amateur paparazzi desperate for a buck. This book is a waste of your money to support his drinking habbits.
__label__2 What no Phish?!: The only thing dissappointing about this cd, is that I heard the original (pre-release) version, when the movie's director added it to the jukebox at a local pub. There were at least 4 more tracks including a great number by PHISH. Maybe once they sell out the first run, they can renegotiate and get the other songs on there.
__label__1 worst toaster in the universe: i wish i'd read the reviews of this toaster before i bought it. it's a doorstop now. it didn't explode, but it did almost cause a fire by burning two pieces of toast on the lowest setting. in this toaster i have never been able to toast one single slice of bread without burning it, in fact. there's something screwy with the thermostat on it. Don't buy this toaster.
__label__1 Did Jeffery Deaver really write this ?: I just discovered Jeffery Deaver, starting with "The Bone Collector" (of course)- loved it ! & have since read "The Coffin Dancer", "The Empty Chair", "The Stone Monkey" & "The Devil's Teardrop". All were well written & suspenseful & had theat all-important dimension of excellent character development. I just finished "Speaking in Tongues" & can hardly believe that the same person wrote this one ! Not only is there a complete lack of any "thrill", the characters are as flimsy as cardboard. I'm glad I've read the other books I mentioned or I'd never have given him another chance. Every author is enttitled to a "misfire" & I guess this is one for the otherwise great Mr. Deaver.
__label__2 Happy-happy-joy-joy: Breakfast at Buck's is a delight. Jamis is inspirational as a writer and a person. The history of the dot-com-boom-and-bubble-and-bust is all here. Jamis explains that he is personally responsible for the bust, in fact. Such a relief when people admit their mistakes. Read it for the laughs and get a surprise jolt of true inspiration. It's a joy.
__label__2 Awsome: I the product was cheaper than anywhere else. I live in So. Calif. and I received this item in a day and a half from Florida. I will for buy from them again.
__label__2 Final Cut Live Rocks: This Cd is worth buying for the Final Cut live,the live version of the song FInal Cut is an expirence not given in many of coheed's other songs, the live version gives you an extened song with more and better solos.
__label__2 GREAT CD. THEIR BEST EVER!!: Quite simply this is the best CD i own. I can't stop listening to it. A classic.
__label__2 Excellent, Quick Read: I picked up Poison Study in my local bookstore because of(gasp!) the beautiful cover art. I read this book in about a day and a half. I couldn't put it down. I found it flowed easily and even had a little romance which I sometimes wish would be in other fantasy novels sometimes, not a lot, but a little. I already have recommended this book to others who have also enjoyed it. I can't wait to see what else this author does in the future.
__label__2 Fast & Easy: Modem was easy to install.One 5 minute call to Charter Cable to give them the MAC address printed on the sticker on the modem and I was up and running. Doubled my average download speed over my old Linksys cable modem.
__label__2 A must have...: Excellent device.....Its got a superb sound quality if you live in a Apartment....I wish it has remote and power button, Overall im happy with the purchase.
__label__2 Impending Doom: This is a great cast of voices. The actors from The Justice League animated show reprise their roles for the first time in nearly a decade! The Justice League induct a new member, and come up against a very lethal Legion of Doom (who Batman inadvertently gives the tools to bring them down!) see how it all ends.
__label__1 ZZzzzzzZZZZZZzzzzZZZZzzzz: Quite possibly THE most boring book ever written. I love history, particularly the middle ages, but this book droned on about topics for up to thirty pages that easily could have been summed up in a page or two. This book is terrible, do not buy it - especially if you are a teacher - Forcing someone to read this book is cruel and unusual punishment.
__label__2 power yoga: I love this CD tho there is still much I have trouble with. I am starting to feel stronger and my back is becoming more flexible and stronger, as well as my abs.While this CD is above beginner level, it challenges you to go beyond. I practice every day and I already see differences in my weight, flexibility, strength, balance, and I am no longer in constant back pain.
__label__1 What a disappointment: If you are like me and your first (and only) Billy McLaughlin disc is one of his instrumental CDs, do not go any further with this one. I own Fingerdance and think it is a pretty great fingerpicking showcase. I read the 2 reviews on this page and thought a live disc might be something worth checking out. Well, I was wrong. Why didn't either of the reviewers say anything about the horribly boring singing with quite banal lyrics? Someone bought it for me from my wishlist, and when I put it in my cd player yesterday I couldn't have been more disappointed to hear singing throughout the whole cd. Not only that, but half of it is religious garbage. There are few parts where he gets to showcase his talents. Most of the time it sounds like a Sting concert gone horribly wrong, with Kenny G sitting in during the 'jam' parts.Do yourself a favor. Save your money. Don't be disappointed. Go get something by Don Ross or Adrian Legg instead.Ugh.
__label__2 Thule 4302 Tracker II Roof Rack Foot Half Pack with TK1 Bases: This was just what the doctor ordered when my daughter tried to put the car in the garage with the kayaks on top...These were replacement parts for our rack system and worked identical to the originals. Perfectly attaches to the factory channel on top of our Escape.
__label__2 Smart spy show with great characters.: USA network is looking better and better. When the other networks brings out more reality shows, CSI copies, hospital dramas, USA got this spy show.Jeffrey Donovan got this spy character down. His sly laughs, gray suits, and smart comebacks works perfectly.Bruce Campbell is a welcoming sight in this show. Everyone knows a retired worker that is a little bitter, and a little bit of a loser. He is completely that character.Gabrielle Anwar also got the happy trigger ex-girlfriend right. She didn't play this character to be weak or vulnerable.This show's writing is smart, well crafted, well acted and doesn't insult the viewer's intelligent (no not that I'm smart, actually a dumb dumb). So, if you are bored of all the same old, same old... I highly recommend this show.
__label__2 She Who Watches: SHE WHO WATCHES is the fourth and final installment in the McAllister Files from Patricia Rushford and Harrison James. When a senator is threatened, and one of his family members is kidnapped, Mac and his partner Dana Bennett try to unearth the truth before it's too late. Making the case even harder for Mac is the fact that they must share evidence with the FBI, delve into Native American tribal customs, deal with political red tape, and he must try to sort out the feelings he has for Dana without ruining their partnership altogether.The characters of the McAllister Files are genuine and believable, the protocol and procedures followed by the detectives factual and realistic. Patricia's story telling ability and Harrison's personal experience in law enforcement makes for a superb story with great characters and believable twist and turns
__label__2 Great for Craft Projects: I use these to print stickers for a variety of craft projects. They are good quality stickers. My printer prints these without any smearing and it is thick enough that I can cut all sorts of shapes and they hold up. Scoring on the back helps peel off the backing with ease, no matter what shape you cut.
__label__1 I CAN'T SEE MY BABY!: I thought this would be the perfect mirror. But after just a few uses, it started fogging up, then I realized that it was not cleanable because IT'S PLASTIC! I have not been able to use it after spending $14.00! It's not worth it, and I wouldn't recommend any mom use it. I'm better off just pulling over to view my baby from time to time.
__label__2 Best coffee maker I have owned: This is my second Mill&Brew. I had to replace the first one because the latch holding the grinding cover down broke. Used cup under the counter to wedge it down for almost a year before I broke down and bought a new one. Was only about 3 years old when latch broke so is not the best design, probably should be metal instead of plastic, but I liked it so much that I was willing to try again. Machine has built in grinding basket so does not use any filters. It is easy to clease and use and makes great coffee, all the pieces come apart so I can wash everything, I put it in the dish washer every so often just to get it really clean. I highly recommend this machine and will more than likely buy another when this one goes.
__label__2 Grandson loves this book: My 18 month old grandson loves this book. He insists on it being read to him, usually 5 times in a row at each reading session.
__label__2 An elegant and indulgent treat .: This book is beautifully designed and laid out. I have read dozens of books on the stones and most of the pictures in this book I'd never seen before, which makes it really special and worthwhile. Great rare photo's of Brian Jones. The text is "in their own words" mostly, and not too deep (much is taken from the interviews done in the excellent 25 x 5 video compilation). The richness of this book is the never seen before photo's and the sumptious design.
__label__2 Historically Valuable but Severely Dated!: Billed as the first all-talking, all-singing, all-dancing film, and it is just that. Taking into consideration the year it was made (1929) and the times (transitionof silents to talking pictures), it does seem like a valuable effort, and it is. Set the movie standard for future musicals, and has been copied lots of times since. This one features, great singing and dancing numbers, and while the dramatic elements are dated they still kind of work, Bessie Love's performance is also great. Extras: this was the second movie to win the Oscar for Best Picture, and the first musical and the first talking picture to win too. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!
__label__1 THIS BOOKS ...!: I started doing the first few lessons in chapter 1 to get used to the new features of MX. Most of them dont work! Plus I had a whole folder flash files (the files for chapters 1-7) that would not open in Flash. The site for this book ... really bad. Its not made in Flash, which show how much the authors really know, LOL. The files are just thrown in their, leaving you to have to browse through arcane named files that usually dont make sense anyhow. The way the book is written, the authors/flash novices seem to expect you to know what files you need. Its a constant steam of read, download file, read a little more, download a file or two, read a little more, etc. etc. I'm sure its a great book overall, but when I find myself getting frustrated for several hours and still being on the same lesson, I say forget it. I'm taking it back and buying a better book, one that whose authors know how to explain stuff.
__label__1 A WASTE OF TIME ...: SLOW START & KEPT GOING DOWNHILL ...No romance, little suspense and not worth reading unless you like crazy, violent people... a sociopath, hit man, etc. I am a fan of Ms. Garwood's wonderful historical romances and really feel disappointed in her current switch to violence. Previous characters were introduced to try to save the lack of plot... it didn't work. Don't waste your money ... read it from the library if you must ...
__label__1 Does NOT fit fuel injected engines!!!: The web site does not specify which type engines this works with, yet the packaging has written on the back"NOT for use with fuel injected engines", which eliminates the last 20 years of cars.Amazon needs to list this in the ad so others do not have to return it as I did.
__label__1 Not for Mac: Not good at all if you use a Mac. It didn't work with OS X 10.2. When I emailed Iomega tech support they said they don't support anything later than OS 9.1, and wern't too aplogetic about it. Too bad that OS went out of date almost 2 years ago. This might be a good drive, especially if it was still 1999, but it's 2002 and Iomega needs get with the game.
__label__1 Very, very poor...: I've had this for a day and I already don't like it. The manual is not helpfull at all. It's a pain to switch between songs and the headphone jack is extra small and doesn't work with standard headphones. The volume doesn't get very loud. For some reason the fast forward button likes to get stuck so it'll start skipping though your songs and all you can do is turn it off and back on. I wish I had bought something else.
__label__2 Elixir strings, top notch: Great feel, pretty good sound. Are the OEM strings of Taylor. I wish the sound would be a bit brighter, but the sacrifice for life and feel is worth it.
__label__2 Action Packed Thriller: I absolutely love the 24 series. The only show I have in my schedule to watch every week. And I enjoy going back to re-watch the previous seasons.Enjoy!!!
__label__1 All Monsters were medium sized at best.: I got this movie because it promised both little AND big monsters. All I got was a bunch of medium sized monsters. I've seen both bigger and smaller monsters than this movie gave me.I went in expecting to be entertained by little monsters, the smallest monster was like cat sized? Really? Cats? I've seen cats before. So you'd think, if they can't get the little monsters right they could possible do big monsters justice huh? NOPE, the biggest monster was at best big boned, not even large. I've seen bigger monsters rolling around on the electric carts at Walmart.The animation was passable for like 1920's computer generated graphics but this is 2012, you think these guys could afford a Lisa or maybe a Commodore PET computer by now.If you're looking for little or big monsters, look elsewhere.
__label__2 Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom!: Sarah Brightman is wonderful, the music is fantastic. This is the full, original recording and is great for phantom fans. I've always loved The Phantom of the Opera, first having read the book and then seeing the play. If you liked the book, I'm sure you'll like the music. It does differ from the book in some instances.
__label__1 I don't recommend this product!!!!!!: I 've already got this baby monitor, when I pluged the monior in it was working well, but after 10 minutes it startid beeping and the green light indicator which shoes that the monitor is pluged disappeared. and it wasn't working any more. I don't know what to do:( I live so far that if I send this product back it will cost mush more than this monitor is, I 'm so sorry. So I don't recomend this product, I have to throw it away :(
__label__1 Product nice, Dog won't wear.: Although the goggles were very well made, my dog refused to wear them. I bought them for bike rides with my dog but they never were used.
__label__1 Failure with two purchases: I thought judging by the look of the headset, large ear cup design, noise canceling microphone, EA, and NFL logo that this was going to be an excellent product. I was wrong.With the first product the volume had to be turned all the way up and even then the sound was way to low. After a couple of tries nothing came through the headphones. I thought well its just a fluke.Then I was shocked to learn that the second headset that I purchased produced no sound. Just occasional static. Both headsets were tried on both Microsoft wireless controllers and new batteries were put in. Both were connected properly.I then purchased the Microsoft wired headset and it works great. Stick with Microsoft on this one. They also have a wireless version which would be worth checking out.The other minor downside is the tight feel. With some people it may be an issue after prolonged gaming. The Microsoft headset has a lighter feel and is more comfortable.
__label__1 Counterfeit: We received a counterfeit battery. Up at the very top of the product page it says this battery is Nikon brand and made by Nikon, but the Nikon website pictured the exact box we received as an example of what a counterfeit product looks like. [...]I suppose if you want to trust your expensive camera with a knock off battery, that's up to you, but this product page is pretty deceitful in making you think you're getting the real thing.
__label__1 Classic Toaster Problems: Great looking toaster. Matches our other appliances very well. We have been very disappointed with the quality. The knobs fell off within a week. The slide bars do not stay down and there is no adjustment for this. No customer service department for help. Buyers beware!
__label__2 A good cd: This album is a great album even though the songs arent on the movie anyone can tell by reading the tracklist but anyhow the cd is good. LL Cool J's song is a classic and all the songs are very listenable. If you like rap and rock this is a great mix of both.
__label__1 Over Rated: This blower vacumn is over rated. It is heavy and cumbersome to handle. Does not do a good job of vacumning up leaves. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 Major Durability Issue: My x-box lasted just over a year. Apparently, a major circuit on the board blew so I cannot play it anymore. Considering I did not play that much on it versus my playstation 2, it deserves the one star. That does it for future purchases of xbox. Playstation 3 should be much better. Go Sony!
__label__1 Not very durable: I was disgusted when this camera stopped working after only 1 week. I bought the A560 to take on vacation, and kept it well-stored in a padded case. With less than 200 shots, the lens cover stopped opening/closing, and then the view screen died. (You could still preview a shot in movie mode, but not in camera mode, and you could still review stored pics - very strange.) The AA batteries tend to last only about 75 pictures, by the way, so keep plenty on hand. I had bought a Canon this time because neither of my Kodaks had held up more than one year, but I returned this and bought a Kodak Z712 instead.
__label__2 Johnny Depp Stand Back ... This is a REAL Pirate King: "Pirates of Penzance" was the first of Joseph Papp's productions in Central Park, and the quality of the operetta's production shows through. The actors range from tremendous (Kevin Kline as the Pirate King and Patricia Routledge as Ruth) to very competent (whatever happened to Rex Smith).The comedic interaction with the orchestra is as Gilbert & Sullivan would have wanted. What they really would have preferred, however, was better camera and sound quality. The constraint is that this is a play performed outdoors, in the summer, in Central Park. Given those constraints, the camera work was admirable and the sound quality quite acceptable.I attended this production, as well as seeing it performed by (essentially) the same cast on Broadway a year later. I have never understood (other than marquee value) why Routledge was replaced by Angela Lansbury on Broadway; you will see that Routledge was an inspired casting choice here.
__label__1 Recovery Revisited: Ray Materson and Melanie Materson have penned yet another "recovery" book not unlike those on bookshelves for the past 2 decades. It's difficult to find the inspiration in the art or narrative provided by the couple. Although it must be time consuming to craft so many stiches into a small space, it can also be said Mozart crammed many notes into a measure. While Mozart's music can be appreciated on many levels by many people, the artistic quality of Materson's work does not appear to have widespread interest among anyone who cannot relate to being an addict. The good news is Materson has returned to society. One would hope other ex-convicts have also put aside the past and become good citizens. God forbid if they all tell their stories! Save the trees please!
__label__2 Video Converter: I purchased the Plextor converter on advice of NERO. They claimed that it would be compatible with their software. After I plugged it in and tried to convert my tape, the system froze. That happened several times. I wrote about this to NERO, they asked me to send them a report. I did that. That was almost two weeks ago. I am still waiting for a reply as they are notorious with their responses. You may want to contact NERO directly, however, I doubt if it will work.In future you may want to put some sort of safeguards in place referring to the software vendors with the description of your product(s).Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the service I have received from you as I bought many other items through you.Martha Pelensky
__label__1 Horrible, Miserable Movie!: I don't like this video and I don't reccomend this video to parents with 1 to 8 year old children. Lots of swears and unsmart events like the man cooking in his car. Why don't you go to Wendy's or Dairy Queen, you wingnut! It's so gross when the teenage boy steps in the cow manure and also when the man is eating and driving at the same time. I almost threw up that time! If you have a Barney loving toddler, I reccomend any Barney video besides this!
__label__1 Good story, but...: The book is good, but the editing errors are so distracting that it's hard to keep focused on the story. The punctuation (Kindle version) is so bad that it seems like it's been translated by someone who doesn't speak English, like the instructions that usually come with cheap, made-in-China stuff. If we have to pay more than full price (Kindle 9.99, paperback 5.99) we should definitely get better quality than this!
__label__2 Elegant and efficient: After using cheap plastic electric kettles, it has been a pleasure to have an efficient one that looks elegant and sleek, and that is also sizeable. Worth saving up for.
__label__1 Bought to replace a laptop keyboard: I bought this to replace a key board on my laptop, the connector cable was in the wrong place, couldn't use it so Make sure before you buy...!
__label__2 The Rest of the Reviews Aren't Lyin': The blue-cover version of this album *IS* in fact better, as it included such classics as "Beat Box", "Moments in Love" and "Close (to the Edit)". However, these songs were licensed from ZTT/Island, and I guess something went wrong. So on this re-release we get tracks from "Below the Waste" and "FON Mixes" to take their place. Not a bad collection, but not what it was.
__label__1 No stars, No story: Unfortunately Amazon doesn't let you rate a book with zero stars. How so little could happen in so many pages, I'll never know.
__label__1 Broken soon after arrival.: The sound quality is good; the bass is clean and not boomy. Unfortunately, one of the earpieces fell apart within a week of their being delivered--the fourth time I used them. I cannot recommend them.
__label__1 Poor DVD set: I'm sorry but this is not a true representation of the show in 1991. The editing company RUINED it. The original songs from the dances were not the same and have missing skits.Now that TV on DVD is all the rage these days we don't deserve to pay a lot of money to have these sets so poorly altered.Anyone wanting to buy the set to have a reminder of how it really was when it originally aired will be disappointed.I want a refund!
__label__1 Terrible: This was a terrible remake. Still don't understand why they did it. When she got hit by Chuck I'm sorry I couldn't stop laughing it was such horrible acting the fake body crying was just to funny not to laugh. Its mean yes but its one of those movies I wish I could un see.
__label__2 PHOR OPEN MINDS*: i first heard something phrom these guys on "Musical Starstreams" ...pleasing to mi lobes of ear.Outstanding flourescent beats and trebs to keep hands off the skip/search^ PEACE & ENJOY
__label__2 My favorite kitchen tool: After reading Wheat Belly by Dr Davis I gave up all grains a year ago. Surprisingly I haven't missed pasta, but was looking for a different way to eat veggies and found this. Omg I am in love! So far I've only made zoodles (zucchini noodles) but it is by far my favorite meal/snack. I make the noodles, put them in a strainer with salt, let them sit for 20 mins, rinse, and saute for 4 mins with garlic and olive oil, and volia perfection!The machine has suction cups on the bottom, so it is really easy to use. It's a bit cheap looking, but it gets the job done. Clean up is a breeze, I just wash by hand.
__label__2 The South Gives Us A New Voice: Sue Monk Kidd is an amazing writer. Her prose sings in a voice that puts her at the forefront of the new wave of Southern writers. "The Mermaid Chair" is the bittersweet love story of a man who is about to take his final vows as a Monk on a South Carolina island and a married woman who returns to the island where she grew up.It's a simple stopy of love found and lost, but the secret of this tale is the prose itself. When I finished reading her earlier novel, "The Secert Life of Bees" I thought here comes a new literery star.I was right.
__label__1 Chapstick works better!: The La Mer skin care line is very good which is why I was excited to try the new lip balm. So disappointing! You would be better off purchasing something akin to Chapstick at the grocery checkout. My lips actually dried out and began peeling after using it overnight. Now whether this was due to a lack of moisturizing ingredients in the product or due to an irritating ingredient in the lip balm, I do not know.I quickly went back to Ole Henrikson's "Fresh Lips" which does an excellent job for $15 per tube.By the way, the sellers on Amazon are really inflating the price of the La Mer lip balm. Retail price is $45 and they are selling it for $55 to $150, which is a rip-off. I purchased mine at Saks and ordered during a free shipping offer, so my total cost including shipping was $45 + tax.
__label__1 Poorly Made: This toy lasted about 7 1/2 minutes in our home with my non-destructive four and a half year old, leaving him in tears. This was a present for him for being a good boy at home and getting through some rough days at a new preschool. The first thing that happened was that I had to replace the cheap batteries (no problem, we are used to that with toys these days). Then, the piston type thing that makes the bucket move kept popping off. Next, the thing just quit moving. We replaced the batteries again, and the ones we took out were so hot the thing must be a fire hazard. My son got so frustrated that he actually cried because the toy he had waited for was just a piece of junk. It is not worthy of the Tonka name. So, I have returned it to Toys 'R Us.com, but Note:: they will not refund the shipping and handling since it is not their fault. So I have paid around $10.00 for shipping and handling for a $15.00 broken toy. Happy I am not.
__label__2 perfect replacement: We had a bad smell coming out of the drain, and the old baffle absorbed the smell horribly. This looks just like the old one and fits perfectly, and no smell :)
__label__2 Great Skate: Beautiful Skates! They are so great to use and they glide so well! My Daughter bought these and they are great! They are perfect size, and they don't run to big or too small in size. So........ I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE SKATES! EVERYONE OUT THERE THESE SKATES WORK FOR BEGINNERS AND PERFECTIONISTS! me OUTTY!
__label__2 Good condition: This book was in good condition and looked just like the picture. Most of the articles are pretty wordy and many require some abstract thinking, but not a bad read. I got this book for a class though.
__label__1 No CD: I ordered this item knowing a CD should come with it to get full use. There was no CD and seller refuses to give full refund stating that I was forwarned. I was not.This seller is a scammer. Also book was listed as new. It was not. Seller was Yuriy Radyk, y-man amazon seller.
__label__1 Atlantis Found Awful!: Never been moved to write a review in many years of reading, but this story is thrown together so carelessly, I found it hard to keep an eye on the plot because of all the sloppy contradictions.
__label__1 DOES NOT FIT MP500: I was very upset when these ink cartridges did not fit my Canon Pixma MP500 printer as the compatibility test said it would. They were too large. The number on the top of the cartridges is 8 while the number on the ones that work is 221. However, Amazon's compatibility check says that those cartridges will NOT work with the MP500. WTF?? Very annoyed.
__label__1 poor release: First Priesthood cd is very goodsecond is even better.I like those 2 releases.good west coast music.This new one I dont like at allto hard beats compared to the rap.the rap aint like it used to be in the first 2 albumsits softerbut beats are harder then ever.wich aint a good combo imo.I give this 2/5 though.
__label__1 Can't use it: Be very careful about buying this product. It does not work on XP's home edition. Unless you have XP Professional, you are stuck with a very expensive doorstop.
__label__1 Depressing, boring, slow: Not sure what everyone else is seeing in this movie. That's one of the worst movies I've seen to date. And yes, Brad Pitt's acting was very so-so, plus there was a whole 5 minutes of it in the entire movie. He probably spent less time shooting it than those commercials he does in Japan. The stories that were shown were rather pointless and boring. I could barely finish watching it. Don't waste your time and money, this one is not a winner.
__label__1 To be and to have DVD: Unfortunately the DVD I received was a region 1 DVD, and could not be played i Denmark, which I informed you about, and after som exchanges of mail you very kindly arranged a refund to my account of the purchase price and I have bought the same DVD from another source, although I probably could have bought a usable DVD from Amazon in the UK, but this information was never relayed to me. I only have to live with the cost of importing the DVD into Denmark, about the purchase value of the DVD, but every experience costs money, normally.So thank you for your service in this matter.Best regardsPeter Daugbjerg
__label__2 Best Daddy gift ever!: This is an amazing book and makes every dad melt when his daughter shares her thoughts and he shares his. My father started the same book with me over ten years ago by giving it to me on Christmas with a few entries in his section. Then I gave it back to him on Father's Day with some of my entries. This was to be our tradition until the book was filled.I now have the privilege of giving this book to my daughter's dad so they can start their tradition (she is still little but why wait).Some dads have a hard time sharing their memories but this allows them to catalog the random things their daughter's will cherish later in life. And they get to know what was special to their daughter.Buy it for your dad, your husband, your brother - any dad you know!!
__label__2 LeapFrog rules!: My son enjoys his Talking Words Factory" DVD, so when I saw this on Amazon I immediately ordered the set.While the math one is a bit short, it still interested my son. He loves numbers, so he was willing to work a bit harder to get the concepts.The Words Factory 2 was as wonderful as I expected. Alec even repeats some of the rules for sounding out words, such as: "When two vowels go awalking, the first one does the talking" and "silent e makes the letter say its name."The little frog included in the package was a big hit as well. My neighbors and I are starting to exchange LeapFrog DVDs and it usually results in "Oh, I have to get that one now."
__label__2 Wow... great knives: I read the great reviews and said what the heck - for $60 - I'll give them a try. I thought I would need to to get a bread knife and chief knife. These 3 knives will cut ANYTHING. Actually, you need to handle them very carefully, unless you don't mind a trip to the ER. I have done that once already, so I am very carefull. Great value for the money.
__label__1 The jury should have stayed out.: I, like many Grisham fans, will normally auto-purchase whatever his latest offering is. The Innocent Man has caused me to rethink this strategy... Vanity Fair ran an article recently regarding the premise of the book before its release and I was intrigued. The article gave a very condensed accout of the events and characters which shape the book. As a magazine article it worked and was very interesting but I think it should stayed that way. Audio book for sale cheap anyone? Anyone?
__label__2 My Mother's Castle: a review: For anyone who knows the intoxicating atmosphere of Provence in France, but does not have the privilege of living there, this film is a delightful escape to that brilliant landscape set at the end of a gentler and more decorous age, already tainted by the horrors of the twentieth century. A must-see if,like me, you wish to escape the horrors of twenty-first century cinema.
__label__1 No response or action: Not pleased. Returned the earrings two weeks ago Fedex at my expense and have yet to hear from them. Noticed I'm not the first with same problem (back came off pearl).
__label__1 Weak academically and otherwise: Professor Johnson gives the total victim typology a full-out book-length workout. Every excuse for the women she cites comitting crimes is dredged out and covered weakly with academic gloss. Most women are in prison for violent, not non-violent crimes, which invalidates many of her arguments for them as primarily society's victims (as prostitutes, drug addicts etc.) A lower % of African-American women are in prison than African-American men, which she fails to cite, and also fails to butress her points. The whinier of the voices she quotes also grates after a while.
__label__1 Not what I expected: I am not happy with the purchase. I intended to use it on top of the stove over the burner. The picture of it makes it appear as if it is one piece of metal, but there are gaping spaces between each roller so the juices will run out and hit the flames. If I'm cooking on the grill I'd rather cook the old fashion way with the hot dog on the grill and getting slightly burned. I don't know of anyone who would "grill" a hot dog on their grill in this manner. I wound up throwing this "gadget" out.
__label__1 A chore to get through: While the book may provide some insight into the Mid East situation and Jerusalem in particular, I found the story very long winded with little action and with not wholly believable characters, events etc.
__label__2 My Daughters Favorite: Our of our stack of books, this is my nine month old daughters favorite book. She loves the bright colors and smiles every time we read it.
__label__1 This was Propoganda against the President that should be banned.: Don't even waste your money. There are better films like 2013 Obama's America than this piece of crap. Hated it.
__label__1 Too much hype...: Maybe my expectations were too high? With all the hoopla regarding this book I certainly expected a lot more than what I got out of it. First of all it took forever for me to finnish reading the book. Though generally I'm a pretty fast reader, this one was a struggle, but I was not going to give up.I am really not sure what the point of the story was except that a lonely older women reflecting on her life.Well I wish the author would have made the reading more interesting and somewhat smoother because at least she had an interesting story line.Other than that, it certainly did not offer anything else but disappointment. Sorry about that.Thank you.
__label__1 It might be a fun game...: It doesn't work. I tried it on several computers. I have to figure out how to return it right now. Unfortunately the envelope was tossed out. I'll figure out who I bought it from and update so you can avoid buying anything from them. It wasn't Amazon but somebody who sells through them. I think my copy was pirated. Well, like I said, I'll update.
__label__1 Worst laptop ever: sound disturbance, restarts with our wanrning, got problem with mother board 4 times in 2 years, needed to change hard drive 2 times,needed to change the DVD drive.i bought this laptop with COMPUSA and all the products i brought with them sucks. lucky that i took insurance with the laptop for 3 years so i am making use of if, but most of the time it stays with the service people as it gives problems every month.
__label__1 What a bunch of sap!: I thought this was one of the most over-written, overwrought books I've read in some time. Talk about saccharin-sweet! Yuck! I will give the author some credit for his description of living with someone with Alzheimer's. That was about the only credible part, in my opinion. I was glad this was a short book; otherwise, I would have flung it into a far corner with a foul oath!
__label__2 Great Understanding for those who cannot always speak: This is a very hepful and interesting insight on understanding those with special needs. Greenspan specifies a light and patient approach for the lay person as well as professionals. This book is a staple in most school districts and should be in each home.
__label__1 Almost no text: I should have read the editorial reviews a little more closely before I bought this book to know what I was getting for my 4 year old. Pictures are wonderful, very detailed-but it's all pictures. No text to read to your child at all. Just make sure you know what you're buying.
__label__1 Beware buyers in the UK: I used this in the USA and thought it was great. Imported one into UK at some cost. Needs v expensive transformer to use. More expensive than coffee maker and postage combined.
__label__1 As a teacher, I found the "sports coach" tone distracting.: There are already dozens of creative writing "how to" books on the market...Why make a student spend this much for a book that's overloaded and at times condescending.
__label__1 Defective, Panasonic says tough luck.: I have a 27" Panasonic TV, I'd sooner give up my mother (j/k Mom!) than part with it. But this lead me to buy the DVD-A120 DVD player and after less than a year it started refusing to play DVDs that worked fine before. Do NOT buy this product, it IS defective.
__label__2 Superb energy of live hip hop performance: This is a completely new dimension of hip hop. For ones that haven't seen them perform live this is an unique experience. Definite must in every serious cd collection, even to those peeps who are not into hip hop at all. Also on second CD you have two videos of them performing and few new tracks. What else could you want. This is a live stuff that breaks all the barriers of the music as we know it today. It's not like DefJam's "Survival of the Illest" where you had MC droppin' lyrics and DJ spinnin' on 1&2. Yes, Roots have scratch sounds, but they are produced from the mouth of two vocalists - Rahzel and Scratch. Also, combination of bass (Hub), drums (?love) and rhodes (Kamal) is da bomb. It's the pure energy, even though it's not played agressively at all. And finaly add Black Thought to drop some lyrics and you have The Roots on stage. Sounds superb!
__label__1 Fun beginning and end, but everything else drags.: The title says it all: James Woods is a vampire slayer out to get the bloodsuckers that killed his teammates. John Carpenter's attempt at the vampire subgenre is mostly middling, with a great beginning (we get not one, but TWO gory massacres!) and an almost-as-energetic finale (which is marred a bit by a final showdown that's waaayyy too short). Unfortunately, the material in-between is horrendously paced and very dull, most of the characters are blase and unsympathetic, and there's a psychic link subplot thrown in the mix. Carpenter displays a solid hand at action and James Woods and Tim Guinee deliver memorable performances, but it never goes the extra step the set-up seemed to promise...** 1/2 out of *****
__label__1 Don't!: This is an appalling film. The scenario is obviously inspired by Escape from New York and there the similarity ends. There is no visual appeal to the film at all and the script is dire! A copy of it sits proudly on my shelf.
__label__2 Spinetta gives away his concept of jazz rock: Every one who has ever listened to Luis Alberto "El Flaco" Spinetta knows about both his creativity and originallity. "Los Ninos Que Escriben En El Cielo" is not the exception. Coupling with great musicians like Mono Fontana et al, "Los Ninos..." drums up a revolutionary twist to Argentinean-contemporary music. Spinetta is capable of giving his own version of jazz-rock filled with poetic words that will have the fine listener stick to his or her CD player. A song like "El Hombre Dirigente" (composed back in the early 80s) anticipates, poetically, many of the traits long criticized afterwards by Argentineans regarding their politicians. Undoubtedly, "Los Ninos..." is a must in every jazz lover collection.
__label__1 Even if you haven't read it, you've read it before: Standoff is such a thin, formulaic ripoff that I can write out a recipe:1 semi-glamorous, shallow heroine1 tall, dark and handsome hero with a Tragic Past1 froth-at-the-mouth villian, complete with rifle1 pair foxy grandma and grandpa1 large gratuitous sex scene2 surly foreigners2 confused teenagersPour into convenience store, sprinkle with cops and TV cameras. Shake, and serve.The resulting froth tastes like its cardboard characters, and will remind you of every TV suspense-movie-of-the-week ever made. There is absolutely nothing original, interesting, or memorable here: a complete waste of time.
__label__1 Zombie baby is too much: I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much. All taboos have been broken there is nothing left. Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore.
__label__2 tough to beat: I have to say I'm totally hooked on this show, I can't wait to get the next season on dvd! As a doctoral student in clinical psych I'd say it's probably the closest thing to real therapy that your going to see on tv or movies, it's the closest I've seen. Of course it's sped up to fit one client into one season, but it's pretty accurate in its depiction of how a psychdynamically-oriented clinician goes about work. The fact that he does his own personal therapy is a major plus for the show, it gives you a great view of the human side of the therapist that you don't see when he's the therapist. Overall, it's a great show. If you like this type of therapy (psychdynamically-oriented, non-manualized, etc.), or if you have had some of this type of therapy yourself, I'm sure you will really like In Treatment.
__label__2 takes a while to get going but WOW is it worth the wait: This novel takes a bit of time to build up steam, but the final pages are worth the wait. What a climax! beautifully written and very worth while.
__label__1 disappointment: I have purchased the book trusting that it is part of brasilian jujitsu series. Compared to other books of the series, photos are not clear at all, explanations are not good, and I am in martial arts over 20 years, I could not see what is for experts. If you want an advanced book get J.J.Machado's one. The jello guard is probably invented just for having invented something. The jujitsu techniques are not advanced at all and the division of the book as jujitsu, submission wrestling, and vale tudo, leaves very little space for the techniques of each group, reducing the book to a mediocre technical level, with few techniques.Do not forget that Sperry, Bustamante, and others are not with him any more. I regret having purchased it.
__label__1 Worst Wireless Mouse Ever Made!!!!!!!: I never thought Microsoft brand was this bad! Bought it in Dec 2005 and tried it for few minutes and returned it the next day. There are 3 issues I faced with this mouse:1. Mouse buttons was extraordinarly firm, hard to feel a click2. Receiver do not functioned as it supposed to (lose connection)3. Mouse feet do not level on a flat surfaceThe only great thing i found out from this mouse is that the laser system works on glossy surfaces.
__label__2 Pay attention to the level you are buying: This is a great DVD for stretching and flexibility. In no way does it misrepresent what it is about. However, the beginning level is too slow and not very challenging for very mobile users. I am 64 and work out regularly although I am having some flexibility issues due to losing muscle when I lost a lot of weight. So when I saw this video I purchased it right away even though one reviewer had noted that it was too slow-paced for her. For instance, I am able to balance without holding onto a chair but I followed instructions anyway just to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the challenge. After completing all the exercises, it was obivious it was not enough. I am returning it today so I can get the most advanced one offered.
__label__1 No: This is the only book so far of James Patterson that I didn't like. I have read almost all his books. I stopped reading after several chapters. Service was good though.
__label__1 Sheesh; it's a paper back: While this is a good book the current prices on available copies are exhorbitant. The illustrations are mediorcre and there are better, current resources. I say go to the library and read it, return it, and if you really want it, wait for a reprint.
__label__1 Hazards of Halogen Light: Light output excellent. But what happens if the motion-detector timer fails to shut off and the high-heat producing halogen bulb stays on?In my case, it caused the outer plastic housing to melt down and possibly to have caught fire, just two weeks after installed. Fortunately, it was self-limiting, but the heat blistered the paint on the wood siding on which the light was mounted. The siding could have, but did not, catch fire, or else the house could have burned down. The manufacturer said it shouldn't happen. But it did. And if it happened once, it can happen again.
__label__2 I Want to Meet Jack Reacher: Child's Jack Reacher is something of a mystery man but one can't help having a certain appreciation for the simplicity of his lifestyle. The bare basics of only a toothbrush makes those of us with way too much, look like fools and thus has a certain pull on me. He is an elequent "Man's Man" and "Ladies" man deeply rooted within espionage.
__label__1 Forgettable: This is easily Woo's worst movie to date. The characters are two Dimensional and the acting was terrible. Mira Sorvino was irritating,to say the least and Chow-yun-fat acted like he had been lobotomised.
__label__2 greatbook: This is a wonderful book. The author does a great job of being sincere without being too sentimental. I highly recommend it.In addition, the book was delivered in great condition and in a timely manner.
__label__2 Brillant groove based metal: sofa king killer are defintly one of the best new bands i,ve heard. This is perfict for blasting out of a stero with it,s infectiously groove laden riffs and throat shredding vocals it will have you nodding your head uncontrolable.For fans of down,eyehategod, entombed but with a sound of their own.Stand out tracks: They all amazing
__label__2 Sixth Grade Math text: My son uses this book at schoool, it appears to be a decent introduction to many math subjects, and continues on the course 2 and so on. It is appealing in looks and examples. However, be very careful- in trying to lighten his backpack I went on-line to buy this. The paperback version is not this text at all- it is a workbook. That is why it is cheap. Somehow my son didn't want more problems to do....
__label__1 Comment on publishing date: I do not own this book. I am posting this review as a question. I have noticed the publishing date is 2000. It is now 2010. It has been my experience when a book contains web resources, many things become dated, are now dead links or obsolete. Is this the case with this book or no?
__label__2 Emergency: This Book is great if you are studying to become an EMT-B cause this book is very good and very good at explaning the basics of become an EMT i think some of the picture are graphic but very well done and i think you will pass using this book, there are other EMT book but i think this one is the best.
__label__1 "Used" instead of advertised "New": Came in a box with no packing whatsoever. You knew instantly that this was a used item. Turned it on and there was a white spot on the screen. Used - and defective!! Sent it right on back.
__label__1 Jim Wallis: Feeble of Mind: As a committed progressive liberal, I found nothing of value in this sentimental and garbled stack of trash called a book. Science and philosophy should be our guide, not some ridiculous notion of a "big brother in the sky". Jim Wallis seems to be enamored with the idea of a groundswell of progressive Jesus Freaks running all over the place with Bibles in their hands. We don't need or want his outmoded and fallacious religion. Science and intelligent discourse are what we crave.
__label__1 Rather dissappointing :-(: Despite her recent offering, Ms Howard will nevertheless still be one of my all time favourite authors. For those whose first intro to Ms Howard's work was Now You See Her....you ain't seen nothin' yet till you read this Top 3! After The Night, Shades of Twilight and Duncan's Bride. P/S Dear Ms Howard, I am waiting patiently for Chance Mackenzie's and John Medina's turn at your creative spinning. Please knock my socks off with their stories!! I hope I don't have to wait till the year 2000 though.
__label__1 Very bad experience: I placed an order for this product. ShopSpark charged me, sent a totaly diferent product and now they don't want to send me the right product.
__label__1 From her heart!: I have seen Gloria Loring perform live and I saw her last week on "The View" speaking about her son's battle with Diabetes. She sang "I Always Will" and blew me away with her beautiful voice and genuine spirit. This song is the most precious gift a mother could give her child. The entire CD is wonderful. Gloria always sings from the bottom of her heart with every intention to please us all.I also read her new book "Moving Past The Fear: Living With Type 2 Diabetes" What a resource for anyone dealing with the disease!!!
__label__2 I love the chair!: This chair was WONDERFUL when our baby was a newborn, it was about the only place he'd sleep! But by the time he was 2 months old and looking to explore things, he became bored quickly. We added a toy bar and he was okay, but prefers the bouncer chair now. It's perfect for newborns to sleep cozily. I recommend this for all moms!!! We have bought 3 people these as gifts and all 3 also love the chair. The bouncers sit the babies too upright and this has just been perfect! Our chair has also gotten a lot of use, we have borrowed it to my sister-in-law and after that one of our friends is going to use it!!!
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS: This game flat out stinks. It's not a game, its a poor excuse to get your ($). First off, the game doesn't work with a joystick, so you have to use the keys... DUH!! The zooming is horrible, graphics are so lame its not even funny, and the overall game play is just plain bad.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Especially if you are looking for something fun to fly and then blow up some enemies. This game just flat out fails to do anything. If I could give this 0 stars, I would, but I can't, so its a 1 star.
__label__2 great book: There are some things that nobody teaches you and marketing over the internet using emails is one of them . This has always been regarded as spam but this is not the case, this book explains all the procedures involved in producing spam free e-mails that actually bring profit to your company . I bought the book, started my campaign, never looked back, is that simple, just full results, no trouble, no hassle, nothing...and no spam alerts either
__label__2 Comprehensive Analysis: The author can be forgiven for writing a book that reads a little more like a formal academic paper, given his illustrious credentials. However, it is a surprisingly comfortable read given the complexity of the industry (if you could call it one industry) and the material covered. His analysis is as comprehensive as it is thought provoking. He does an excellent job of portraying the myriad of complex relationships between various evermore technologically sophisticated players within the health value chain. I would have preferred more coverage and discussion of specific company/organizational profiles. But, his artful and deft handling of the complex subject matter presented in a way that gives the reader many "aha" moments makes this book a must-read for anyone serious about the business of healthcare.
__label__2 poor software I can not connect it to win.xp: I am spending hours to find out1-Were I can not get any information how to instal this product to win.xp.2- How I can transfare picture from DSC to my PC (even with my former win.983- How can I send email?May be somebody answer meoverall I give zero rating for this product web info,and help
__label__2 The last of real men: Written in the final years of bifurcating sexes and social decorum, "Call Me Mister" is an in-depth look at becoming a man- shortly before it was forgotten how.It's practical lessons on the importance of self-betterment, personal dignity, being well-read and articulate, and the respect and treatment due to women have sadly dated much more than any clothing style.Being in it's target audience (16-25), I can say that "Call Me Mister" contains lessons scarcely found today and serves as a testiment of our social regression since.
__label__2 Get your Emotions to Rock Your Audience: This well written book conveys the importance of really connecting your audience to your charcters feats, flaws, and final acts. It a lesson well learned for any screen writer, think of your favorite movies, they made feel emotion for the heros, the villans etc. This emulates that concept through and through.
__label__2 Good for the price....: Like many other owners have said, it really must be "adjusted" at a bike shop for optimal use. The front brake takes some adjusting to sit just right and I personally had to rip off the plastic cover by the rear gears to keep the chain from catching, but after all this, I am still happy with the bike, seeing that others would have cost me $600 and up. I've taken this bike down trails at 35mph, jumping every bump on the way down, and as long as you keep the chain taught in a high gear and tighten all the bolts down well, you will have no problem. If it can handle the trails that I take it down in IL and MO, it should do just fine for most riders. I saw simalarities in the design of this bike to some Ironhorse models ranging from $1k to $3k, and that did it for me. Here's a pic of the bike in Shilom Springs State Park.
__label__1 You need a 5 gallon bucket!!: From all the glowing reviews I thought that there was no what I could go wrong!WRONG!I expected a nice leather bottomed bucket shaped tool bag.WRONG!This well made, well designed circular belt is made to slip onto a LARGE 5 gallon bucket. The bucket is not included!Also be aware that a 5 gallon bucket is pretty big - not your usual around-the-house bucket but a large bucket (normally white) used for industrial jobs.Maybe this is what you want. It was not what I wanted!
__label__1 Beware the Defragmentation: This may be a very good program, but I will never find out. The first task I chose to do when Drive Genius arrived was to defrag my hard drive. That one procedure rendered my computer all but useless--some programs would not launch, the time was off and could not be reset, saved email could not be retrieved, and other abnormalities. Prosoft's Support was unable to help me. I'm not sure that Drive Genius offers any advantage over Tech Tool Pro or Disk Warrior, or a combination of the two. If you get DG, back up before you defrag or, better yet, bypass that feature.
__label__2 perfect for the odd reader: This book has a great plot along with the fantastic display of the author"s imagination. Poppy Z. Brite has an imaculate writing skill I LOVE THIS BOOK
__label__2 A W E S O M E P R O D U C T ! ! !: TwinLab - Ripped Fuel 5x, 40 tabletsI've used this stuff for several years. I've actually compared the difference with it and without after several Months of working out. The product seems to really help me define. Also, great for energy. Probably due to the B-12. Either way, It works for me and the price is right. Great addition to my supplement arsenal!
__label__2 Know your Roots: When i first heard minor threat i was too young to appreciate the punk/hardcore scene. Then, years later when my tape broke i bought the CD and it was awesome. For anyone who likes punk rock and for anyone new to the scene this is a good place to find your roots. Although, theres not much music by these guys they still made their place in the punk industry and i highly reccomend it.
__label__2 Helpfull with other sources: I do like this book since it does cover a lot of material for the paralegal which helps with leagal research and writing. The problem is in the writing style of the text, it truly will make you fall asleep. There are alsop a lack of useable diagrams when it come to writing law office memos. The formats however are presented rather well and I would reccomend this text to a paralegal to use as a reference but look into other materials which help aswell such as QUICK STUDY LAW LEGAL WRITING BAR CHART.
__label__2 Encyclical for my reference library.: It is a provocative document, well worth reading. Just wanted to have this on my Kindle for reference along with other Church documents.
__label__2 The Beatles - Live At Shea Stadium: As a lifelong Beatles fan I was delighted to find the DVD "The Beatles - Live At Shea Stadium". I had bits and pieces of this historic performance and had always wanted to have the full concert performance of the Beatles as I had seen this live when I was 10 years old on the ABC broadcast of this event. Never seeing the FAB 4 live in person myself, this was a real find to get the entire Beatles performance on DVD. I didn't know this was available until I saw it listed on Amazon!
__label__1 Don't buy it.: This book was a great disappointment. Obviously, he doesn't understand the underlying purpose or theme of the Book. He had to complete his NT commentary series, and this is what we got. Not up to his other writings.
__label__1 Juicer Died during the third session.: I was able to get good juice out of this juicer the first and second times I used it. I got about 30-40 ml juice per large carrot I juiced. I am not sure if another juicer can make more juice and reduce wastage. Anyway the juicer's motor died during the third session. After 1 carrot, the juicer stopped. The motor wouldnt budge when I turned it back on. The motor of the juicer seemed to have died. The product looks fancy. Luckily I bought it from Sears where I plan to return it soon. If you were to buy this juicer, buy it from a store you could return and get your money back.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!: I would not buy this camera. Several customers have had numerous problems with this item (including myself). I received a call the other day from Agfa saying that they do not plan to restock the eSmile camera. They will give me a refund (after I fill out a bunch of paperwork....when they mail it to me). Honestly, save your money. This camera is a bomb!!!!
__label__1 What an idiot: I really wanted to be inspired with this book, but after plodding through it, it just made me totally disgusted with Aron. Total disregard for all the mistakes he's made and continues to do the same stupid things over and over again. It didn't help that I also saw him on the show 60 minutes. What a total narcissist! Hate to admit it and not to sound racist, but Caucasian people never learn from their near death experiences with nature - they just get right back to what ever stupid thing they're doing!
__label__1 SAVE YOUR MONEY: This thing is nothing more than a for the moment hair conditioner. Just like any other hair conditioner that you rinse out. It does what other conditioners do,..makes your hair very soft and it leaves it feeling healthy. For that day. It doesn nothing to repair damaged hair. My hair was the same condition the next day after my shampoo. I did not expect it to be repaired perfectly,..but it was like I never used this product. If Im spending this kind of money on a conditioner,.I expect results.
__label__1 Only for some readers: I couldn't finish this book. I forced myself to finish the first third of the book about Waterhouse and Newton. The second third, about Half-cocked Jack and Elisa, was significantly better. But when it deviated back to complicated politics, I had to put it down for good.I admit I might not have exemplary reading comprehension skills, but this book is very hard to read. You must know a lot about math and science, a lot about European history and politics and must be able read deeply into nuanced dialog to be able to understand this novel. I understood about 40% of the Waterhouse book and 60% of the Jack book. Stephenson's writing is good and witty, but also pretty difficult and long-winded at times.This book is not for everyone. Anyway, read the diversity of reviews on this book and you'll be able to tell if this book is for you.
__label__2 This book is not just super, it's super-duper. Super-duper!: Mr. Lamb's elegant expose of the sordid social and political lives of two U.S. senators deserves high praise. Who would've known that two of our country's most distinguished luminaries are afflicted by a neurotic obsession with cheese? Who would've suspected that two of the hottest stars on the contemporary political scene exhaust valuable office time smearing each other with various dips and sauces. Between you and me, they're partial to Hollandaise sauce, but that's all I'll say. I don't want to let any more cats out of the bag. There is, though, a final kitten that I will set free. Buy this book. Next to my collection of Charo biographies, it's about the neatest batch of words I could hope to come across. Ciao. Foofy McDougall
__label__1 act your age ladies: Seriously, this has to be the funniest thing i have seen in ages, a load of girls in their twenties strutting around trying to appeal to eight year olds, its just obscene! I feel sorry for the familys of bewiched and i feel sorry for the little kiddies that have been sucked in by the corporate giants of this otherwise credible industry.Bwiched, GET A LIFE!
__label__1 Pyrex is no more: It turns out that this mixing bowl is not made by corel, and is not the high quality high temperature glass originally used. Corel sold of it's Pyrex brand to another company called World Kitchen. WK uses common bottle glass for all it's Pyrex line, rather than the 'lab glass' that made pyrex worth buying.I was forced to purchase a replacement for the 16 year loyal pyrex measuring that finaly broke. It arrived today, complete with defective bubbles and cracks through both the handle and bowl. Return shipping will cost more than the item did to purchase, so I am out of luck.If you are looking for the quality pyrex that has been used for generations, you are out of luck. It has not been made for a while now.
__label__1 Very disappointed.: I am a huge Harry Potter fan. watched all three movies in the theatre at least twice, got all the DVDs, etc.I think Chris Columbus did a good job with the first two, but Cuaron messed up the third one big time. I don't think he has even read the book thoroughly enough to truly understand it. PoA, my favourite book so far from the series after the 5th, was expected to be the best HP film yet by many Harry Potter fans, but it is the truth that many were disappointed. I used to think JK Rowling was kind of harsh with the whole sticking-to-the-book thing with the Chris Columbus, but now I can see that she said that for a good reason, because PoA turned out to be a wee bit better than just 'crap'.
__label__2 Give it a chance.: I would have to say I am an old school RPG game fan and not seeing many of those I picked this game due to the great reviews.I played it for an hour and put it away for 2 weeks.So not wanting to have wasted the money I gave it a chance and played past the Prologue.After that the game took on a different feel and its a bit enjoyable except for the comic book scenes (rather than real voice the dialogue is done through a single picture with word bubbles...next picture,more word bubbles.)All in all old school meets new school.Either get used to it or stick to RPG card games,least thats how I see it.
__label__2 This Book Rules!: This is the best Animorphs Book i have ever read! I order you to BUY THIS BOOK! BUY IT NOW! Its the best!
__label__2 Excellent Magical Book: The book I am reviewing is Harry Potter: Prisoner of Azkaban by j.k. rowling. This is Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. I thought it was a great book. Kids ten and over can read it, but it would be hard for ten and under to read because there are some hard and complicated words they might not understand. It was an excellent sequel to the second book; I could relate to it because harry's 13 years old, is a troublemaker, and has a great imagination. So I recommend this book to you.
__label__2 A GENUINE BARGAIN: An Excellent product at an unusually low price. 500 Aspirin for only $6 with Free Shipping. I received the item on the third day after placing the order. It just doesn't get any better than this.
__label__2 Fantastic Movie!: This movie is one fantastic movie. Of course Cuba is in it and I really think he is one of my favorite actors. The only thing I would have liked was for Cuba to be the lead commander. He plays the second in command, but his attitude draws in the men to almost the point of being the commanding officer.Other than that one thing this movie rocked!
__label__1 My son hates this toy: My son got one of these for Christmas. He was 9 months old. He will not ride on this thing. Everytime you put him on it he cries for you to get him off or he falls off and hits his head or something of that sort. He is now 13 months old and will not touch this. This toy may be fun for some kids but not for all. He has the hardest time moving on it when he does try to ride it, the wheels stick to carpet and will barely roll.
__label__1 Is everyone here deaf?: Just looking at the cover of this album lets you know of the horrible insipid dreck inside. B'day is a perfect name as that is the french word for the plumbing that cleans your backside. The picture of her looks like Faust collected early on her soul. Oh my lord, this is the worst music imaginable. She just wails into the microphone instead of singing. Singing loud and high doesn't necessarily make you a singer. Jay Z also has you sheep fooled. Simply repeating your rap name and saying words like flow and go...... Someday the public is going to wake up to the fact that most rappers are talentless and soul less idiots who aren't motivated enough to learn an instrument and write songs of their own. When I hear songs off this album I just want to poke my eardrums out. Please quit buying this garbage so it will go away!!!
__label__1 liberal fascist agenda: this is one of the worst pices of garbage in the universe liberal fascist pig writes his version of mein kampf. this [kill] is [barack] one [obama] the worst [now] dumbest men ever.o support ted nugent go uncle ted fellow patriot.
__label__2 Good: I bought this CD having never heard of the band. I really like it. The song writing and playing are really good. I bought it to hear Dave Grissom, but he's only playing guitar on a couple tracks. Even so, this disc is currently in my disc changer and will likely stay there for a while.
__label__1 Do not buy this book if youre programming STL: I did not get any benefits of this book, sadly.It is useless with Siemens S7 and you want to learn the STL language.To few examples with this language.Sorry
__label__2 Set of Madeline videos: I was very pleased with this item which I purchased for my four year old granddaughter. She has really enjoyed these videos. I have not seen them available at any of the retail stores where I have shopped.
__label__1 One time use...: I purchased this set for the larger sizes mainly, so that I could remove some foot pegs on a dirt bike. I was able to remove & re-install two bolts, but the T50 is now twisted to the point where it's unusable. It got the job done...once. I may never have to use it again, so the price was right for a one time use product. I would purchase a higher quality set for repeated use.
__label__2 Love the Seals: Great product. Only issue is that they do not hold their suction well after about two months of use (I have gone through three pairs and found that they just lose their grip after a couple of months). Nevertheless, it's a great product.
__label__2 This is the phone to get for 2005...: I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW! Its eveything I had hoped for and plenty more. The phone's outter shell looks and feels great. It doesnt have that certain, cheap plastic feel unlike other phones like the Nokia 7610 which is a complete joke. The S710a has an absolutely gorgeous screen and the digital camera actually takes pretty decent pictures unlike all other picture camera phones that litterally look like junk. I highly recommend the S710a to anyone who's looking for a full-featured cell phone in a good lookin' outter shell. Definately worth the money unlike other high dollar phones like the Moto Razr which is another joke. The S710a from Sony Ericsson was well worth the wait.
__label__1 Worthless POS: Ditto to the other review. I have two and both indicate the indoor humidity is 60+%, but my AC guy tested my home (both floors) and it is 54+/-%.
__label__1 Waiting for the twist that never came.: I guess I'm numb, but I really couldn't wait to get to the part where you find out that a good character that you trust is actually evil. It never came, but my anticipation got me to the end of the book. I guess I was looking for a twist. There were none, which was especially disappointing considering the subtitle reads, "True evil has a face you know and a voice you trust."Aside from that, I have to agree with the folks who complained about product placement. I mean, I was embarrassed for the author, it was so bad. It was frequent enough to significantly cheapen the novel as an art form, in this case.I bought it at the airport, and it got me through a long flight. I guess that's what it's appropriate to expect from an airport novel.
__label__2 Are All the Songs on This CD.: I do have a problem with this release I was going to order it but why do they say certain songs are only on Album does that mean not on cd or are they calling the cd album now.Does anyone know please place in a review so i know.Thanksi do like Dusty Springfield if anyone is interested some years ago there was the Hullabaloo series which MPI since has cancelled,but i have them all and Dusty is on a few appearences there when she was very new along with petula Clark,also check out the Ed Sullivan Rock N Roll collection i believe she is on his show also.
__label__1 Returned after 3 days: There was much static and people complained they could not hear me. the plus side to this phone was the abilty to turn the ringer off on the handset. I returned this phone after three days. I am still searching for a decent portable phone.
__label__1 Second rate commercial pap will always suck.: It doesn't matter when or where the music comes from, if its characterised by dull chord progressions, hackneyed lyrics and lousy production it will never stand the test of time. The songs in this compilation will NEVER NEVER make the grade. I grew up in the eighties, and this collection of truly awful radio hits is testimony to the conservatism that characterised programming at this time. Images of overweight realtors and shopping mall managers twisting and frooging to this dreck at their local beer barn permeate my tortured consciousness. Thank God Nirvana and other bands with integrity came along and changed all that.
__label__2 So Much Emotion!: This CD is fantastic. I first heard "Orphan Girl" on a cd compilation a friend made me. I was very moved by that song. I'm not a fan of country, and I hadn't really heard Emmy before that song. She sings with so much emotion that I had to hear more! And this CD, was my first purchase of her music, and I loved it all. My favorite remains "Orphan Girl" but I can't find a bad song on this whole CD.
__label__2 Great Series: RIVITING ! Next to Dexter this is my favorite program... This certainly beats watching the election campaign and conventions. Hope they make another season.
__label__2 Pretty Good: My only complaint it the snaps on the collar. They are difficult to use and velcro would have been a much better option.
__label__1 Doesn't work with my DVD burner: Pinnacle studio 9 did a good job except that it would not do anything but waste blank after blank on my burner. Their site claims to be compatible and I did the firmware update. They were good about giving a refund since the product did not do what they said it would do.
__label__1 Beginning of the end of American leadership in sciences: The sad reality is that year after year fewer American students are going into the fields of science and the best students (and teachers) are increasingly brought in from overseas. Most recently non-citizens in the U.S. have received more Phds in the sciences and engineering than citizens.The fact that (un-)intelligent design is given a sounding board or that idiots like Phd theologians are pining on scientific theory shows how far we've fallen behind. In a generation or two moronic ID theories will vie hand in hand with New Age idiot beliefs while leadership in real science and technology migrates to Europe and Asia.Shame.
__label__1 Kittie just aint Kittie!: Far out is this just Morgans band now? i brought the CD and theres 10 tracks and basically everything on it is just about done by Morgan.Id have to say from the reviews ive read on here id agree with Scott Hall the most Kittie hasnt been the same since them 2 left. Although i think Orcale was still a good album , this album has droped even more from where Kittie used to be.But who em i kiding this isnt Kittie this is Morgan and friends really.
__label__2 Very good book I ever read: I found it very helpful to prevent medical errors occured in administration of medicine to patients. It should be read and considered thoroughly in order to give your patients a safer service.
__label__2 A Great Book on a Sports Legend: This book was excellent. The author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the 20th century: Babe Ruth. Overall, we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong 20's into the 30's.My only issue was that I didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death. I would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death. Plus I would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his death.Nevertheless, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan.
__label__1 Not my cup of tea!: I really didn't care for the book. A very sad story about some very sad people. Most of the main characters, in my opinion, are mentally ill. Their illness is a result of horrendous events in their lives. I think it shows how mental illness can carry down through generations as well.I never got to a point in this book that I didn't want to put it down. That is my test of a good book. I read it for a book club, if not for that I probably would not have finished the book.
__label__1 Not so good..: A typical product for DVD...It's not a bad movie, but it's not even close to greatness. The kids were really annoying, Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise (as always).. bah, I don't know...
__label__2 Pricey, but larger than you'd think: The bag works well (especially for traveling with dirty cloth diapers) and is much bigger than we expected. I still think the $20 was a bit high though.
__label__1 Thirty Years That Changed the World: Michael Green is masterful at describing the lives, trials, triumphs and even the thought patterns of the early Christians. One would be tempted to believe the author was an eye-witness, so clearly and succinctly is the story told. Easy to read with wonderful insights into the era of the Acts of the Apostles.
__label__2 Good tool pouches: The clip on the bag is useful for tethering it within my larger tool bags so I don't take the pouch(es) out and leave them somewhere by accident. They are quite durable.
__label__2 EXTREMELY MOVING: I have not had the pleasure of listening to this album yet. When I heard(sign your name)on the radio. I was speachless. It is one of the most touching and rythmic songs i've ever heard! I've been searching for months. To find the album that this song is on. With a song that brilliant on the album. I can only imagine how good the rest of the album is. I am looking forward to purchasing this masterpiece!
__label__2 Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.: What can I say, I like chick flicks and this book is a well-written chick flick. Somewhat predictable but the story is still fun to read. Every character was developed thoroughly. Maybe it is predictable because you understand each character and know exactly what he/she will do next.

__label__2 Hoyle Board Games 2003: I constantly play this game. The characters are almost alive, and they insult you at every opportunity.
__label__1 Okay: This game got really high reviews and I was excited for something different, but overall I think it's pretty lame. My daughter is 9 and very "into" card games, but this one really misses.The tin is cute and the cards are durable though.
__label__1 Not bad if it works.: This is my second sony camera. My last one just died and would not power up. Now I've had this T100 for a couple of years and it is a nice camera with histogram... if you get one that will last more than a few years that is. My pics now have a green tint and I've changed/reset all settings. I think the camera is dying. It isn't worth the money Sony wants to send these type of cameras in to get fixed .. So it's basically a dead camera. I won't buy another Sony.
__label__2 The movie that launched a career: This is a 'Saturday Night Live' movie before it became a cliche. Steve Martin was 'born a poor black child', yet becomes a multi-millionaire with an invention that eventually makes people cross-eyed. Throughout the movie he is a bumbling fool and has unforgetable situations and lines. It's bad enough to live in a service station, but when you're excited about being listed ("The new phone books are here! The new phone books are here!), you just have to leave common sense at the door and hang on for a wild ride of silliness.
__label__2 Premiere: A lovely CD but not my favorite of Katherine's. She has such a beautiful voice though and is a delight to listen to all the way through.
__label__1 Way too big: These are Over-the-Calf and I did not realize what that meant. They are very tight and went way up the leg. If that is what you want then they should be ok.
__label__2 A great fantasy Tale - A Must read!: What a wonderfull Book!A truly great fantasy story, I read it years agoas a child, and It's great coming back. There are so many layers to this story it's amazing. It's really a must for our time.The tale speaks of Momo - a Nice little girl, that knew how to listen (If you think you know too, read the book...) And has to save the city from the Time stealing men in Grey. The whole idea of Time in this story is lovely...Just go on, and read it!
__label__2 interesting, and well worth reading: Although lullaby is far from Palahniuk's best novel, it is a delightfully clever look at society from a character easy to relate to. It doesn't flow as well as Chuck's other novels, but is still full of twists, and the dark comedic element makes this book a fun read. I recomend this book to both new and old Palahniuk readers.
__label__1 Severly Modified: I was very disappointed with A Night at the Met. I use to own this on VHS tape. Since I am commuting now in my car, I decided to buy this album, because I loved the routine. Unfortunately, the best parts of the comic performance have been edited out of the CD version of Robin Williams' performance. Most noticeable to me was the bit about marijuana and the cat, which is sadly missing. I was really hoping to relieve the performance I had watched many times, but sadly, due to the editing of this CDs, it will most likely be shelved.
__label__2 Great sound, Perfect for classical music: These speakers sound very clean, and work very well together. They can't quite replace the need for a subwoofer, as the bass sounds a little forced. They're perfect for listening to classical music, which I do a lot of. The sounds is especially crisp for vocal and orchestral works. However, for hip-hop, which I also listen to, the bass is somewhat weak. Overall, a great deal!
__label__2 GREAT BUY FOR A LITLE PRICE: I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to make comic books.This help me some what, it talks more about how to make zines and how to publish them. But I still found this book use full because it gives tips on how to create your on book, how to make home made paper and new ways of designing the exterior and interior of your home made book.Over all it is a good buy and is helpful to anyone who enjoys art and printmaking like my self!
__label__2 For long time fans and new fans...Mirabal is always great!: If we hadn't had an ice storm in December, I would have been at the theatre when the PBS special was taped! I missed a wonderful performance. I saw it later on PBS. I am so glad the CD is now available. I've been waiting for it. His music is great and the group gives a lot of energy to their fans. If you are a new fan, try his other CD's. Each is special.
__label__1 "Ramatam"? More like "Rama-lame": Had high hopes for this record but did not like it.Apparently there is a reason you used to see it in the used bins: it's just not very good.Over produced and underperformed.Blues Image is a lot more interesting.Ramatam sure looked good on paper though.
__label__1 Good For Something: I definitely wouldn't recommend the Day of Reckoning: The Massacre At Columbine High School to anyone. It only points out the negativeness of a poor writer. Mr. Murphy does not use correct grammar/punctuation. He could have checked for spelling errors. There were so many spelling errors thoughout the book. Mr. Murphy jumped from one idea to the next without warning his audiences. He seems to know more about the military then he knows about the Columbine Massacre. I look at television, play violent video games with my nephews, and look for things on the internet, but it doesn't mean I am going to be violent toward peers/co-workers. Mr. Murphy is a very poor writer. One thing for sure, when I write my next paper I will be very cautious about all the negativeness I saw and read in this book. This book will serve as a reminder when I write my next paper. The book only pointed out things I shouldn't do when writing. Thank you Mr. Murphy.
__label__1 A rather convoluted dissapointment: Sadly this book is simply to convoluted to be of much help. Perhaps the books scope (SQL in general) is the books weakest point. It often seems like more time is spent explaining the differences between DBMS's than discussing the fundamentals of SQL. My advice is stay away from this book and instead go with one tailored for your DBMS.
__label__2 dont get no better: I found this while in my house. I must of been my moms. I have th evhs tape. This is incredibly funny. I was hooked on richard ever since watching this. He is the funniest man alive. Here is a very good reason the buy this. This is his best work. He is his funniest in front of the microphone doing stand up.Buy this you wont be dissappointed.
__label__2 One of the best movies of all time!: Saving Private Ryan feels so real at times, you think you are in the middle of a battle. The action sequences are extremely intense, and are not for the weak of heart. Before this movie I really thought war was more glamourous and simple. Speilberg has opened my eyes, and showed me what war really is, brutal and dehumanizing. I couldn't even imagine having to go through with that in person. Everytime I see the movie, I wonder, how would I react in a situation like that. Thankfully, because of those men and women who sacrificed themselves, I can live in a place were i don't have to worry about such things. The movie is very moving, and should be seen by everyone. It will make you cherish the things that we sometimes take forgranted.
__label__2 THiS iS mY FaVoRiTe CD Of aLL TiMe!!: Dru Hill definetly did it again.. These 4 men are ASTOUNDING! I love them! They are so amazingly talented!! I've had this CD since it came out in '98 and it hasn't moved from my CD player! This album is AWESOME! Anyone who hasn't bought it, you are missing out on the best CD ever.. I'm not exaggerating at all. All of my friends seem to agree also because everyone who has it (which is just about everyone!) simply adores it just like i do! So y'all gotta go out and buy it if you haven't already!!
__label__1 Overwraught!: I eagerly awaited the book's arrival, as I was an officer on board at the time the author fell overboard while the ship was tied up in Newport, RI, May 1963. It is mostly legal documents referring to her suit for damages, but it is certainly a poor history of the ship (which she always refers to as the USS J.P. Kennedy, Jr.) when its name is the USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. She reprints some of its history, but somehow completely skips the years 1960-65 (I was aboard 1962-64). Most of the pictures have nothing to do with the Kennedy, or indeeed its mission.It could hardly have been more boring or less informative. If you must have it (no library will) buy an inexpensive used copy!
__label__1 Fairy tale: If you want to read a fairy tale buy this book if you want the truth go to black op radio, JFK Lancer, COPA, Jim Marrs,Mark Lane,HaroldWeisberg etl. Yes I have talked to witnesses and read everything available since the 60's. The truth is not in this book!
__label__1 A long and rambling tale that loses the reader: While the beginning of E. Annie Proulx's novel, Accordion Crimes starts off well, the reader is quickly lost as the accordion moves from one miserable owner to another. I truly was bored by this book, but did finish it.
__label__1 Difficult: My first Barbara Vine book, and definitely the last. I persevered through about 2 thirds of the book and never once understood what was going on. Several little episodes failed to capture my attention or imagination, and I'm afraid I just couldn't face the struggle through the remainder - maybe that would have brought some meaning to the book, but by then, I just didn't care.
__label__2 flying superman: I found the item to be well made and easy to use. It was a clever idea and my grandson enjoyed it a lot. Using Amazon was also a plus, no crowds to contend with.
__label__2 Wonderful: I really enjoyed this book. It was wonderfully written and I wished it could have been longer. Ms. Starr allowed Scott and Vanessa's relationship develop almost realistically. I enjoyed the humorous parts of the story as well and the more serious parts. I often forgot the interracial aspect of the book. I'm definitely reading the sequel to this story. Buy it. You will Enjoy......
__label__1 Read The Books: Here is my positive and negitive lists. Positive: Good Acting, Good time passer. Negitive: weak special effects, bad alien voices, toatlly different from the book, visser three looks dumb. All in all this was the best of the four, but they do weird things, like they find ax in the forest and Cassie has long hair in some episodes and short hair in others. I suggest you read the books.
__label__2 Pur water replacement filter: Very happy with the product. It does a nice job of providing clean, good tasting water.
__label__1 FALSE Advertising: It lists the selection of eyelashes to choose from, and I chose 19A. Instead I received 19, not what I wanted at all. And when I asked about it, the seller said that they choose what eyelashes they send you. What is this? Why would I want to pay this much for a random pair of eyelashes I don't even want? Unsatisfied with this purchase.
__label__2 Good Book: My niece was excited to receive this book. It had good examples for her to practice her new skill of calligraphy.
__label__1 Paif for magnetic, didn't get what I paid for, 2, top and lock side magnetic, hinge side unacceptable, compression type: poor, it made me put one star bvefore it would accept my review, waste of a star.
__label__1 Never Again: I don't know why Rowenta has such a good reputation!!After only a couple of months, it does not get hot enough and does not steam.The sole plate on it is difficult to clean and gunks up quickly.I lost my receipt so I am unable to return it and called Rowenta and they looked up the Serial number and since it has a shelf life of over a year old, they won't honor the warranty.Beware of this IRON! It is not all that they say it is.
__label__1 Lame, Lame and more lame: Silly little predictable movie, I cant even say it was amusing. It was so dumb. I liked all the cast and the acting was fine it was the silly story that was so horrible.Save your money folks and watch a Gilligans Island rerun.
__label__2 Lindsay Lohan: i hate bratz it's stupid with there big heads and thin bodybratz creaters have got to stop makeing those stupid productsthe Lindsay Lohan doll is great though it's pretty it comes withpopcorn a movie premrie bag and much more so if yoiur gonna buy any doll today buy my scene productsps:Lindsay Lohan luv they outfit
__label__2 A Handy Reference: As a system developer using UML for the first time, this book has been a great introduction to the techniques of analysis using UML 2, as well as a handy reference to pick up when I have a particular question about a diagram. Recommended!
__label__1 bit uncomfortable :/: I know theyre cheap headphones but I've bought cheaper ones which work better. They dont fit too comfortable in my ears actually...
__label__1 Blackwater 60 Minutes Sepcial: This video is to short and lacks any real detail about the inner workings of Blackwater. The video is only 7 minutes long, and is just a review of standard news reports. More information can be found on YouTube. Do not waste your money on this 7 minute video.
__label__1 Not worth the money: I bought this unit about a week ago and I will probably send it back tomorrow. I can live with how loud it is but it simply does not cool the air! I've let it run for the past 12 hours and, while I haven't had problems with the water tray despite high humidity, it's only about 5 degrees cooler in the little room than it is outside. In other words, it does a bit better than a regular fan but costs way more to buy and, I'm sure, to power. For a 10,000 BTU rating, it doesn't do half the job of my old 5,200 BTU window unit. I've called the company twice and no one has gotten back to me yet.
__label__1 Surprised...: Be sure to read the find print. I was planning on using this book as a tool to help me identify and treat skin conditions in clinical practice. There are no pictures in this book, which for skin conditions you would think wouldbe a necessity. If you don't need to visually see the skin condition then you may be able to use this book, but as for me it sits unused on the shelf.
__label__2 Amarte Es Mi Pecado: This Telenovela was one of the finest I have ever seen. I highly recommend this it!Pat Thomas
__label__1 Dull: I recommend that you not waste your time. I have found that the quality of Niven's writing has diminished greatly in recent years. The ideas for this book should have been turned over to Robert Silverberg. He would have made an entertaining story out of.
__label__1 Buyer beware..: I received my grill and I also found the packaging was not adequate to protect the grill. One of the corners of the base was badly bent and 2 of the inside tabs (that hold the heat diffuser plate were bent down flat against the side. I was able to bend the metal tabs up enough to get the job done, but the bent corner is still somewhat mangled. The tool tray has to be ordered seperately and it is quite a bit smaller than the grill, causing it to slide around on top of the grate and bang when being transported. The tools included with the tray have a "cheap" feel to them and the tongs are completely useless. I gave 2 stars for the novelty factor and compact size..
__label__1 Not acceptable: I was quite surprised to learn that the filter is not designed to be water sealed. While the installation direction clearedly says that it is required to apply Teflon tape, it still feels like a 19th centry technolodgy. On the bright side, a small scroll of the said tape is included in the package.The installation is easy and simple. Unfortunately, when we attached our shower head back and tested it for the first time, the filter could not sustain the water pressure and broke into two pieces. Luckily the only casualty was our light bulb.Item returned without much of discussion. I hope this company's got a good return policy.
__label__2 One of a kind!A must!For pet lovers and music lovers alike.: Music not only for the pet, but also for the soul. My dog, Thor, a great dane, rolls over and almost hugs the speakers when I put on the cd. And if I'm in need of some soothing background music, I'll pop in my cd. When I need to de-stress while at work, I go to www.musicsite.net and go directly to the Dog Radio station that plays the cd all day long and I'll leave it playing in the background. (For those of you who have cats... Check out the Cat Radio station) Great for my dog and perfect for me.
__label__2 LOL: Kevin Hart is HILARIOUS- bottom line. I would recommend any of his stand up audio/video. This is one of his older works. He's only getting better with time.
__label__2 Wow skills!!: My son has Ot issues with hand movements, and this is perfect and fun!!! he loves to see the animals inside and he can open the locks and put them back!!! Great for motor skills, also!!
__label__1 Not so good: If I were to compile a greatest hits of Modest Mouse I would take track six and track ten from this album...the rest really don't work for me. There are better Modest Mouse albums to buy...don't waste your money.
__label__2 Hoppy does it again!: What's not to like with five Hoppy movies? Although one of the five has some transfer problems, the joy of watching square-shootin', rootin'-tootin' Hoppy and his Bar-20 companions take on the bad guys is truly a fun way to spend some hours. Any western movie aficionado will love these films. Looking forward to collecting all the sets in their glorious black-and-white Lone Pine settings. William Boyd remains one of the definitive cowboys of the genre.
__label__1 Sell me what I want, not what you do!: I agree with the fact that I want what I want, not what the studio does. I already own the extended version on regular DVD, the only reason I am interested is because of the picture quality on Blu Ray. I will NOT buy other that the extended version on Blu Ray. I can and will wait until they offer what I want!
__label__2 Decent guide for visitors to major Texas forts: This magazine-like book describes about three dozen forts "that held a key role in the Indian campaigns." Thus, only major forts are included (The Alamo, Forts Brown, Bliss, McIntosh, Duncan, Belknap, Stockton, Davis, to name just a few). When and where each fort was established, a brief historical account, and the state of the fort today are given in varying degrees of thoroughness. The last chapter is barely a listing of various less important forts. Many of these forts are today state or county parks and offer something of interest for the visitor to see. A handy guide for travelers visiting these sites.
__label__2 Laugh and Draw with Jeffereson Machammer: This is an excellent book by a now largely unremembered cartoonist of the golden age of magazine cartoons and illustration. This is the book that influenced me as a boy in Ohio and I have never forgotten the autor's name. As near as I can determine, this is the only book he ever wrote. He did, however make it count. Jefferson Machammer created a distinctive style women is his work that has never been surpassed or equalled. Broad shouldered with long leggs and expressive faces and body languge, only Bill Wenzel has ever come close to his style. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is that it was published nearly seventy years ago and remains a contemporary piece of both instructional and reference material as well as an entertaining work by a truly great artist.
__label__1 great coffee until it worked: This wa my 4th esspresso machine and my second Briel. I loved this machine when I first got it > It made great coffee rich,creamy and even looks good on your counter. Well that being said after 8 months water started dripping from the head unit occasionally until it became impossible to make coffee without water leaking everywhere spoiling any chance of enjoying a cup of espresso.I would avoid this machine if you dont like headaches.
__label__1 Not a fan: I couldn't even finish it, and I really wanted to like it. I couldn't get interested in the characters. I didn't laugh, or even smile. I felt brad was trying too hard to be funny, but not original. It is someone's humor...I guess, sorry to say, not my definition of humor.
__label__2 Good way to control your music PC: I was looking the way to control the music stored in my computer, without walking from one room to another, where I have the amplifier and speakers and started searching for a remote controls when I found this, for a very good price compared to others and decide the purchase.Surprise! It's very good. Signal, sound quality, and the remote is small and beautifull.The only bad thing it's that you can't connect other sound devices at the same time in your computer, because this bypasses the sound signal of the computer from the Sound Out to the USB where you connect the device.
__label__2 At Least Fuhrman Drives to a Conclusion: Greentown: while interesting, didn't really drive to a conclusion. Dumas did a very nice job of showing all the contradictory evidence and demonstrating how it could be inconclusive enough to bring something to trial. BTW, i don't blame him since afterall he has to live in Greenwich. What's great about Fuhrman is that he asserts what can be logically deduced from the facts at hand--something which, if it had been done in 1975-76, would have meant that this crime would be solved. Right on, Mark!
__label__2 Superman For All Seasons Puts The Kansas Back In Superman: After reading the entire novel, it is easy to see why one of the people the book is dedicated to is Norman Rockwell. From the story to the art, it does feel like an old slice of Americana all the way to the end. Like the others have said, this story is about a farmboy learning to be a hero to the world. It spends a lot of time on Clark's roots back in Smallville, almost more than it does on Superman.The artwork seemed strange to me, at first, but eventually grew on me and turned into almost artwork like a famous painting. Some of the pics are very beautiful and could be displayed on a wall in a frame. It didn't take away from the story, but actually added to the feel of what was taking place. Overall, I definitely recommend this book to Superman fans.
__label__2 This video is really helping my kids learn to use the potty: I am potty training my almost-three year-old twins, and this video is a big help. The songs are catchy, and the production is not too "clinical" -- kids enjoy watching the story and aren't just bombarded with potty facts. I would have preferred showing use of the bathroom in different situations -- public toilets, other people's homes, etc etc. There is also no disucssion that the child might still have an accident, but overall it's well worth the small price of the video. (end note: you too will be humming tunes such as "She is a Super Dooper Pooper" after watching this -- aahhhhhh!!!)
__label__2 This book is hilarious: One of the funniest books I've ever read. It's exciting, funny, and surprising. I am a big fan of the Wally McDougle books and I think this is one of the best. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good laugh.
__label__1 Boring: This CD would be a lot better if for every time Celine sang the word "love" she substituted the word "mayonaise."
__label__2 Fantastic!: I noticed a difference between this and another B Complex I was taking from health food store. The form of B12 in this formula seems to make a difference. I feel so much better on this product. I have fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue and this product and the others recommended by Dr. Teitelbaum are making a difference in my life.
__label__1 2 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Dated, overlong, and poorly-acted, West Side Story features some nifty choreography but its plot is so irrelevent and ending so obvious that it's not exactly like there's a whole lot of suspense; if musicals are your thing you might want to watch it, but otherwise don't waste 150 minutes of your life.
__label__2 power house: This is a fantastic rod if you are use to casting department store rods and you cast this amazing piece of equipment you will be pleaseantly suprised at the ease at which you can acuratlly throw your line, it takes almost no effert to hit your mark and this unit really roll casts extremely well, this is a no frills rod it is all about performance and that is what you want if you are going to catch fish, I forgot to mention the price it is not cheap just inexpensive! This rod is a genuine bargain, this rod will cast just as well as any of the $300-$400 fly rods it is light and feels very smooth and powerful when you cast it, it is a real keeper in my book.
__label__2 All about veddy proper English tea: This delightful volume captures the charm of the ceremony of afternoon tea, from the glamor of taking tea at the Ritz to the coziness of taking tea by the fire with the curtains drawn against the blustery day. Literary quotations, historical anecdotes, recipes for all the best delicacies served at tea, tips on tea-making, and lovely line-drawings make this book a must for tea-lovers and Anglophiles. It is a treasure to have.
__label__2 A Wonderfully Made Film: This movie is one of the best of its kind, as far as I'm concerned. Five stars all the way, perfectly made. I was born in 1935 & grew up in L.A., CA during WW2 so have a keen interest in that critical period and have read about it & am collecting film commentary on it. This movie is a sterling addition.to my collection. Semi-documentary in styrle, detailing the horrors of that time & place wihtout dwelling on them. Music being used sparingly. A true story, very well told. So much could be said about it - but I will only say that like the films about Anne Frank it has found a place in my heart.
__label__2 Godsmack is awsome: I dont have the cd but have heard it from my friends I like the song Keep Away, Bad Religion andGet up, Get out but my favorite cd is KoRn Life is Peachy
__label__2 "Secret Prey" John Sandford: The PREY series always a good read and this nears the top of the list! Keep putting his books on Kindle.
__label__1 Lost it's Touch: This is one of the most dissappointing books in the Lioness quartet by Tamora Pierce. There was too much on relationships, too little on battles... a trait that I thought would stay throughout this series.
__label__1 Save your money!: This book may have introduced some interesting concepts back in 1969, but, compared with books on similiar subjects like "Enders Game" by O.S. Card and "In Conquest Born" by C. S. Friedman, it is simply boring today.
__label__2 Best collection!: This DVD collection is hilarious! It was a lot cheaper buying it here on Amazon than at the big box store!!
__label__1 it let me down: I've owned this jumper for almost a year ,mostly used it to inflate tires or beach balls and etc., few days ago tried to jump start my truck which has not been driven for over a week ,I hooked it up and son of a b*&@#h ,click click and click!, so I figured needs more charging so took back home and plugged it in , 2 days later tried again and same thing ,click click and more click!, so I called AAA ,and aaa guy showed up with a hand held jumper 1/3 in size! hooked it up and i was able to start my truck!!!, good thing i didn't have to use in real emergency!
__label__2 An amusing dilema...: This is a really fun film, that has a pretty sharp knack for taking an irreverent, yet at the same time respectful view of religious beliefs. How Mira Sorvino, as a modern-day Virgin Mary, gets pregnant is outrageous in and of itslef, but the angst she goes through afterward leading up to the blessed event is sometimes funny, sometimes sweet and filled with sentiment. It's a low-budget movie (though with stars) and some of the scenes work better than others (the tempo varies) but the jokes and story are good, as is the acting. It's, all in all, a little gem.
__label__2 Motorola V220 Cell Phone: Came on time no problems with company. Refurb phone did not come with manual. Plugged in SIM card charged up works like a champ.
__label__2 I'm sure it kicks ass.: Welp, I have not seen this film yet but I'm sure it's damn good. it is the third installment of the "Winners and Sinners" trilogy directed by Sammo Hung. I've read lot's about it, and even saw the laser disc at the store but didn't have enough money to buy it.
__label__2 My daughter loved it!: My daughter loves this book! Lots of information presented in a very fun way. We also have COW which we have read until the cover is falling off.
__label__2 I Was Taken Back to My Innocent Years!: Kathy Mattea has taken me back to my Innocent Years! This CD has brought me back in time, like a time machine.. With her beautiful alto voice, as she sings with so much feeling and depth of her soul. All the songs are sung with such beauty, the musicians deserve a great applause also. It seems like forever while I waited to see Kathy Mattea write again and she sure shines in "The Inoccent Years" and "Calling My Name." She really shows that a love song can be done with success in songs such as "I have Always Loved You", an "Thats The Deal." I cannot stop playing this CD...
__label__2 not good buy but great perfume: perfume seems cheap but cheaper in ebay sorry amazon its true,but great product amazon is the best though in tracking number shipping quality gotta be honest with the readers,this perfume is my fav its very sweet and girly im a candy lover and that why i luv it!
__label__1 Don't believe the hype!: I love Spike Lee movies --- "Do the right thing," "The 25th Hour," and "Clockers, but this book by Kaleem Aftab is shallow and meanders to the point of infuriating. At best it's a surface portrait of a complex man and his films. The book is an easy read, but never delves into the complicated world that Lee has created on and off screen.
__label__2 Sennheiser means value: I never usually take the time to write reviews but I just wanted to let everyone know how great these headphones are. You will not find anything better for your dollar. You can actually tell someone that you spent big money on them, and they would believe you after hearing them. Best value!
__label__1 when "weird" means "incomprehensible": Harlan Ellison has written some many memorable, bizarre stories in his day. However in this collection, 'Deathbird Stories', I am afraid my review is polar opposite of the glowing reviews posted on amazon.com. I really couldn't find anything of value in this book. The stories are almost unintelligible in their incoherent rambling. Rather than cool, these stories are a total mess. I was utterly disappointed. I give it two stars instead of one only because of the author's reputation (...I almost never give one star reviews).Bottom line: not even worth the one dollar I paid for it at a thrift store. A total waste.
__label__1 Lots of errors.: The code in this book is often wrong, which is very difficult for beginners to figure out. Concepts are explained well, though hashing is not as emphasized as it should be, and leans towards the end of the book, which in a college setting, could easily confuse many students. There also isn't as much as an emphasis on testing code and creating reliable software for all the discussions on why to make reliable software. The concepts also jump around a lot more than is good. However, the metaphors are very good and the overall text is decent.
__label__1 This is Sony?: I brought these earbuds because the ones that came with my iPod hurt my ears after a while. I needed something that would fit in my ears comfortabley. After reading the reviews I decided to go with these.For me, these are very comfortable as they give you different size buds for different sized ears.The downside is I do not find the sound to be anywhere near the quality of my original iPod earbuds. I don't hear the base at all with these.The bottom line: If you prefer comfort over sound, these are great in my opinion. But again, if you enjoy sound clarity find something else.
__label__2 Great Value: The watch is beautiful and works perfectly. Great value for the money. Shipping was prompt and packaging was appropriate for gift giving.
__label__2 Great phone!: At a great price.I just regret a little when I see the fee on my bill for Blackberry services, remembering that my wife just use the phone for the "call" functionality...
__label__1 Defective Item: Item exactly what I wanted. Then it leaked and the company would not replace. It's leaking more now and I try to fix it with clear duct tape but there's white rice looking seeds all over. Rating system is misrepresenttive. According to my caluculations, Nature Way deserves a 2.6 rating on 1-5 scale.
__label__2 Galimoto: This is a book I ordered to send to my grandson for his birthday. It was sent directly, so I haven't really read it. It got good reviews and he likes the story. It was shipped well ahead of his birthday. All was well. Thanks
__label__2 Nice and solid: I am very happy with the mixer - I did a fair amount of baking over the holidays and it was a pleasure to turn it on every time. Solid mechanics and structure. I was a little concerned that when folding some very dry dough (I was short a couple tablespoons of extract), it seemed to be clunky. I know it says that if the beaters should hit the side you can adjust it, but I want something at this price point to be without flaw. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
__label__2 Excellent: Desi's teaching style is excellent. He relates what he teaches to songs, which has helped me understand the application of guitar theory. This is one of the best I've seen for intermediate level guitarists.
__label__2 write error failure: freak!!! it won't let me change my star rating. I rewrote my review ofr this product. google "write error failure wd passport." You'll get a lot of hits on this one. I've had it for several months now, and this thing was always a bit of a worry. When I tried to safey remove the hd, it wouldn't allow me to safely remove even after 10-20 minutes of retrying and closing all my programs. So of course I removed it unsafely. So this kept on going for a while and then one day it gave me a write error failure, and I lost everything. Yeah not fun people...not fun. So I've been talking to WD tech, and went through all sorts of diagnostic tests and such, and yes surprise, there's an error. If you do purchase this, I would go to the WD website, look up the DLG software and run it for errors. If there are errors, I would contact tech support right away.
__label__2 Pirouline Rolled Wafers, sooo good.: Pirouline Rolled Wafers: Gave as presents and all that received raved about them, I knew they would as I really liked the taste, texture and simpleness of such a good treat.
__label__2 Sinbad Likes........: This is a great CD, so much better than All Killer No Filler. It has 3 instrumental songs, which are great, but i think it would be nice if it had more songs. All the songs are great, and fun to listen to, but its not the best CD, so i gave it 4 stars. I like all the songs, but these are probably my favorite: "Makes No Difference","What I Believe","Machine Gun","Summer", and "Another Time Around"
__label__2 such a lovely book: if old romantic art makes you swoon, this book is for you. it's lovely and romantic and tiny! fits in my purse for a perfect "under a tree" read.
__label__1 very average: this film never quite gets off the ground.Whoopi Goldberg&Ray Liotta just don't have any real Chemistry.it feels Artificial for the most part.these two talents are capable of Better than this.
__label__2 learning fun: I bought this product for my Kg students. They are loving it. The only thing I would suggest is a bag for the stamps or a cover for the wooden box it comes in.
__label__1 When dinosaurs Die: I read it to my kids after they lost their Grandmother. I skipped most of the parts dealing with suicide and other really grown up subjects. Then I put the book in the closet. I did not like this book. And I think you should really borrow it from the library and read it first before you buy it.
__label__2 Great music: I love this CD. It's wonderful music to listen to in the car on a long drive. It has a nice blend of some of her best recordings. I'm very happy that I purchased it.
__label__2 Van Gogh (Getting to Know The World's Greatest Artists): This book offered a great resource for my classroom. There is a lot to read about his life and history so I would definitely not use it as a read-aloud. I do however, use this book to point out significant events in his life. The illustrations are light and add humor to an otherwise depressing life. They bring the artist to life and that makes it easier for my students to relate to and it keeps up their interest. Informative and enjoyable, this book is a must have for teachers.
__label__1 Very grainy blu-ray picture: Maybe I got a lemon, but this is easily the grainiest and poorest quality blu-ray picture I have ever seen. At first I thought it might be my player, which was getting pretty dated. So I upgraded to a brand new player, and viewed the movie again. And it looks exactly the same. My old VHS version of the 1939 classic looked a lot better than this blu-ray version. Very disappointing.
__label__2 Kept me on the edge of my seat!: Tess Gerritsen can really weave a tale- I love knowing more about Maura's background. Strong women are part of the tale.
__label__1 Lid Leaks: These glass pitches are heavy duty and very nice....except that the lid leaks when pouring, making a mess. I replaced them with another glass pitcher within about 2 days of using.
__label__2 LOVE the movie, it's become a tradition in my house: Is this a grand cinema masterpiece? No. Is it a cheesy, sappy, predictable yet inspiring, happy ending holiday movie? YES!! And that's why this is my go-to movie when I'm staying up late to wrap presents or write Christmas cards.
__label__1 A Cure for Bloodlust: This was a beautifully written novel. The words on the page completely and accurately painted an image of the old west. How accurate can be debated, but i would assume that this novel is closer than Gunsmoke or Bonanza. It is the content of the novel that caused the low rating. Before reading this i would have considered myself a "fan of violence". Well, this book was the cure for that. The prose was so vividly, sickeningly accurate and lifelike that i felt i was there, watching the most brutal, senseless atrocities imaginable.Imagine if Michelangelo had used his immense skills of creation to make a very vivid, accurate, precise painting of a rape scene. That is what this novel is. If you can get past the hideous violence, this is a good book, however that was something I was not able to do.*I wrote this review a while ago, after just having finished the novel, with time it has grown on me, it was fantastically written, just too violent. But I can see what others see in it.
__label__2 Just fine for what it is: We do a lot of canning in the summer, and this is just what we needed for those days when we can 40 jars of tomato sauce. My only suggestion would be to put a bit of a spout on one side (or both sides for left-handers) to make the pouring a bit more accurate. It is, indeed, a BIG ladle, just as it says. Also good for serving soups to big groups.
__label__1 rather dissapointing: The gameplay has really gone down, and theres nothing really new in this game, compared to older editions.
__label__1 Do these people have the same soundtrack I do?: I bought this soundtrack on the strength all the 5 star recomendations here. After eagerly opening the CD and listening to it, I can't believe we're hearing the same CD! Most of the tracks are bland, pretty much generic Hollywood stuff. Just the occasional traditional bagpipe or drum to remind you that this is the Braveheart soundtrack. Sure, I enjoyed the movie, but this CD is far too overrated!
__label__1 worth what you paid for it: I took a chance because of the great price. It isn't a bad staple gun, and it isn't a good one either. Jams too frequently and is difficult to clear.I will purchase a different staple gun that is better built.
__label__2 My daughter loves this series: I give it a 5 star my daughter loves the series & it's hard to find. It's worth the purchase.
__label__2 The scrumdiddlyumptious Rainbow Six review: This is a very good book. It is about a group of international anti-terrorists. They are known for saving high profile political heads. One of their members is an old man who is losing is edge. He has to deal with his loss without hurting the group. He is a man who is a war hero, but needs to settle down.
__label__1 Gene Kushlan is an ASS...................: The worst experience ever. The welds broke and Kushlan Products told me I had to ship it back to their site at my expense and then pay the shipping for the replacement. I threw the piece of crap in the dumpster and went to Lowes and bought one of their like mixers.
__label__2 This CD rocks! One of the best cds i have ever heard.: The first time i listened to this cd, i fell in love. This is not only because the previus 4 cds made them my favorite band. Every one of their cds have gotten better. This cd is so much more than just " pretty fly for a white guy" It is solid all the way through, and ive listened to it almost every day since i got it. That was FOUR months ago!! I warn you, if you buy this cd, you will fall in love with the offspring. I DID
__label__1 "What a cheap toy!": My mother had bought this toy before my son was born, we saw on the comercials how the baby would rattle the rattle and pooh was suppost to shake. Well, when my son was finally old enough to play with the toy it didn't work, as far as rattling the rattle the bear wouldn't shake, we had to keep pressing the tummy for it to shake. So we end buying new batteries for the toy and that wasn't it, it just didn't work, i was so upset to have my mom by such a cheap toy, it was false advertisement!!
__label__2 Deeply humane: This is in some respects an uneven book, and I wonder whether Kramer's purpose wouldn't have been better served with a less overtly polemical approach. But his powerful intellect -- and equally powerful capacity for empathy -- shine through on every page. I realized, having finished the book, that I had much underestimated our pseudo-admiration for depression, and the toll that takes. Kramer has written a searching and deeply humane book, and I highly recommend it.
__label__1 Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas: I read this book really fast to simply get it over with.It was just too sweet. And I hate books that kill off animals, especially dogs. I found the "happiness" of Suzanne just unreal. I am almost 50 years old and I have known and know many people in my life and the sugar coated diary was just too icky for me, not in the least realistic.I will not buy any more of his books. But my Mom is just happy that I read one.
__label__1 weak kneed: This series obviously suffered horrible rewrite ambushing as the network slashed their future (& their budget) by axing a second series. It shows, the CGI sequences are weedy and the dialogue becomes trite & suitable only for simpletons.....shame....as an idea it had potential.
__label__1 Horrible Snack: These seaweed strips are disgusting. I can't get the nasty flavor out of my mouth. I totally regret purchasing them.
__label__1 Great idea but broke early: This is a great product in theory but after 2 uses it got a hole in it and had to be thrown away. We ended up buying a similar product that only has the tank top and the tube and it has been much more durable and mich easier to get my 19month old son in and out of. plus it can be blown up by mouth rather than using a bike pump
__label__1 Do not buy: When I placed the I ink cartridge in the printer it always produced an error message on my printer. It would never print, when I removed the black and put my used one in it finally recognized a new cartridge but of course it was empty so the test page only showed color and it wouldn't print any of my reports because it would always say low ink. Needed to buy a black one at target fit $19.99
__label__1 Awful-a lesson on how to make a bad concert video: I am a fan - but this DVD was unwatchable and unbearable to listen to the audio. The cutaways to the audience was just awful and made this difficult to watch. It should have been in widescreen and it should have been in a quality 5.1 audio. The editing of the music was terrible. I was very disappointed. I hope they get the message and the next time he does a DVD they do a classy job which this concert deserved.Better DVD's that were in the stack that came for X-mas was: Deep Blues, Hendrix Blue Wild Angel, and Clapton One More Car - were all excellent.
__label__2 Pumpkin Moonshine - 60 years later!: If you've never carved a "Pumpkin Moonshine" you've missed a wonderful part of Halloween. As a little girl, Tasha Tudors delightful story was a favorite of mine. My children grew up carving pumpkins, not into jack-o-lanterns, but into Pumpkin Moonshines. The "grands" now enjoy grandmothers love for the season and the wonderful "Pumpkin Moonshine" with the re-release of this beautiful little book to be loved by all.
__label__2 Long Time User: I bought my first copy of this book over 20 years ago (Old Blue Cover ) after borrowing it from a friend. Myself and others have used it several times and saved hundreds of dollars . I myself have rebuilt a Dryer, serviced Washing machines, Refrigerators , Ranges, Dishwashers. After reviewing the newer edition and with the changes in appliances its time to replace it. More than pays for itself first time it's used. A must for any homeowner, Renter, unless wealthy and want to keep local appliance repair business in the manner to which they've become accustomed. Everyone that borrows mine has similar comments.
__label__2 So far so good: I finished this book and am now applying what is in the book to my own body. I'm feeling alot better, have more energy, and folk say i look better. Perhaps it's wishful thinking, but maybe it works. I know one thing that is fact, I lost 10 pounds. Also, the guy makes sense and the book is an interesting read. I only just started the program so I can't as of yet let anyone know. All I can say is the first impressions are looking mighty good.
__label__1 Is whitehouse.org ready for a book?: This was a less accomplished political satire than I'd hoped, and I'll admit my expectations were high based on the website. I thought the "worker bee" could have gone farther and been more entertaining and zanier.The content on the site is superior, and it's possible that the authors aren't ready yet for good content to translate to an entire book.
__label__2 Relive the olden days: Well written. Excellent photography. Really show off the Queens of the arilines.
__label__1 This telephone has no answering system.. You cannot record a message or receive messages.: Wish I had read the description more carefully. This was puchased for my husband who has a hearing disability and needs a speakerphone. This telephone does not have a way of recording messages or leaving a voice message on the phone.
__label__2 WE NEED MORE "AMBITION": YES IT HAS COME TO THIS! MADONNA MANIA HAS SPAWNED A COVER VERSION EXPLOSION,AND ITS ABOUT TIME.THE MAIN PLAYERS IN MADDIE COVERS ARE "WHO'S THAT GIRL" AND "BLONDE AMBITION" AND I MUST ADMIT "LIVE TO TELL" TO ME IS A CLASSIC,FAR BETTER THAN AMBITION'S TRY AT COVERING "CRAZY FOR YOU".TO TAKE A SLOW BALLAD LIKE "LIVE TO TELL" AND TURN IT INTO A JUMPING DANCEFLOOR FILLING TRACK MUST HAVE BEEN NO MEAN FEAT BUT THEY DID IT,EVEN THE VOCALS BY TONY CARNEGIE SOUND CLOSE TO THE MADDIE ORIGINAL.SO IN CLOSING I WOULD URGE YOU TO BUY THIS,PUT IT ON YOUR STEREO AND REMEMBER THE EIGHTIES IN TRUE NINTIES STLE. P.S. IF ANYONE HEARS OF ANY DANCE COVERS OF "MATERIAL GIRL" OR "TRUE BLUE" LET ME KNOW.
__label__2 So much fun!: I played this recently (with a group of 30 somethings) and it is HYSTERICAL. So much fun, but half the fun is watching people play and their reactions when they get "shocked." A great game to bring out in a crowd - adults or kids. Someone in my group got it as a white elephant gift, and I liked it so much I had to search for it here. A must at a good party.
__label__1 1.75 thumbs down: I thought this game stank on ice. I wouldn't spend good money on this game. The game is too simple, too cartoonish, too boring. There are some times that it was amusing, but not enough to justify spending money. I found myself returning the game the same day I rented it. This game should have been released for the PS1.
__label__1 False advertising -- not jasmine: This hand cream contains no jasmine! It says jasmine on the front, then says in the description on the back that it's jasmine, but there is NO JASMINE in the ingredients, and it of course has no jasmine scent whatsoever.
__label__1 good, not enough: the title says it all... this isn't really my thing for taylor... glad he won american idol though, he gave a twist to the stereotype of pop princess that i'm sure everyone's sick of... but i expect much better things from him!!
__label__2 Great DVD player: I love the size of the unit and the fact that I get over 6 hours of active use with the battery -- great for those long flight to Europe. I have had mine for over 6 months and it works like a charm. One of the best units on the market.
__label__1 Dis-Appointed only one good song on the album.: I'm a D J and I'm dis-appointed in this album.I expected to hear more upbeat songs or at least good ballads.The interludes are crazy.
__label__1 I finally skipped to the end: It could be I'm not sophisticated enough to have enjoyed this book - half of it, anyway. At times I was caught up in the story and flowed along in it, but more often I felt it was about putting out a great sentence. It made me wonder if writing is like acting - you shouldn't be thinking about the person acting, but rather the character portrayed. I was picturing Pearson smiling with his choice of phrases (and many made me smile too) and otherwise working the words, but is that supposed to happen? The length of the sentences, sometimes repetitive, eventually made me want to skip over them. Like "enough already!"
__label__2 OEM Eheim tubing: OEM Eheim 494 tubing with original Eheim package. It's fit perfectly with all pipes and will buy from PetCareRX again if needed.
__label__1 broken handle: The handle was broken, it had a serious chip snd a crack that ran through the handle where it met the cup. I had to rrtirn it immediately.
__label__2 Their best: The time apart must've helped; Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart have made the best album of their association together. In place of the sometimes tiresome histrionics Lennox would go into when singing in the past, you get vocals here that sound assured and full, brash when called for and moving and soulful the rest of the time. The songs are SONGS, thank goodness, and the arrangements take full sonic advantage of your ears without pummeling them into chutney. This is one of the best albums of 1999.
__label__1 Where is the volume button?: My son adores Elmo, but he is deathly afraid of this one. It is WAY too loud and he is afraid to even go near it. Other than the dance, there isn't much else to this toy.
__label__2 Reprint of a classic: This is a reprint of a very good book by John White -- likely to take advantage of the 'Prayer of Jabez' craze. While this book might not have the same popular appeal as 'Jabez', I believe it presents a more balanced perspective on prayer through the study of ten unique prayers in the Bible.Even 10+ years later, the observations and lessons from this book still remain true. If you haven't thought much about prayer and God's interaction with us through prayer, this is a great place to start.
__label__2 better written than the first: Book two of the series was much better than the first. for one thing the actions of the characters were at many points unpredictable yet fit in perfectly. these actions were very well motivated and didnt leave you unfulfilled. The second thing is the author provides you with clues and prophecies as with the first. such hints give you a faint outline of plot and emphasizes the rising action perfectly. Thirdly, this book expands on previous characters with history of each race while at the same time invents new characters and troubles with the roran story. this book shows improvement on a young author and promises an amazing third.
__label__2 Please Don't Buy This Book!: Please don't buy this book. If you do, that will be one less person committing Death by PowerPoint, and one less person who might need to seek my services or attend my conference. One less person boring an audience with gratuitous animation or overladen text slides. Does the world really need one fewer person committing presentation blunders in public?Well, the world needs about 15,000,000 fewer people doing those things, and Claduyne is the person to be singing that message. I particularly like how she advocates in Chapter 4 for templates that actually contain content instead of just a slide master or two. And a few pages later when she writes "refuse to give up white space" -- yes! And do you own a wireless remote, as she recommends? No?? That's like a carpenter not owning a hammer!So please don't buy this book...but if you insist, I am sure that you will master your inner monologue (Chapter 7) and become the magic in your own presentation (Chapter 9).
__label__1 Be prepared to spend a LOT more money: This product allows the child to only access a very small percentage of what displays in the game as being available. For about 80% of it, when they click to do that part of the game, it gives them a message that their parents need to become members for them to have access to the additional games. Membership is $7.99 per month or $149 one time fee! I don't recommend this at all, because I think it is bait and switch. My daughter is extremely upset because we cannot buy the membership, so she can't play most of the game. She has really enjoyed the parts available to her, but the company should make it CLEAR on the packaging that a membership subscription for an additional fee is required in order to access most of the game.
__label__1 Seller Rip-Off: My wife bought this book on my account for my birthday knowing I am a massive Led Zeppelin fan. This is a 7.99 paperback book(and cheaper elsewhere) sold at 24.99. They've even got the cheek to charge delivery.I am not happyI haven't even started the book yet
__label__2 Great Novel!: A wonderful book from beginning to end! Although there were some slow sections, I found myself looking forward to reading more. I have never heard very much about Iranian culture and found this to be a refreshing change to the current books out there. I was caught up with the psychology of all the main characters and Susanne Pari does a great job in creating so many diverse personalities. I look forward to more novels like these.
__label__2 Beautiful book, beautiful artwork: I love this. I fell in love with this artwork many years ago and wondered about the story behind it. I cannot wait to read the whole story.
__label__1 Flimsy: This thing has three very lightweight legs that bent under the weight of unevenly distributed broccoli heads (seriously). When I tried to bend them back two of them just snapped off, making the whole thing useless.
__label__1 Very Wordy and technical: I thought this would be more behind the scenes of how to create animation, but the copy I received was about music in animation. It was very wordy, lengthy, and perhaps more for the professional animator, not an amateur or hobbyist.
__label__2 Awesome for the price!: I've wanted television headphones for ages now, because I'm sensitive to noise, both from indoors and outdoors. I probably drove my husband batty, telling him to turn down his TV. Now I don't have to, because he uses these headphones when he's watching TV or playing video games, and I use them when watching television and want to drown out the neighbor's dog barking and other noises.They were a breeze to set up and the sound is amazing. I've walked through my entire house with them and the sound never went out once. There is a slight hissing noise, but it doesn't take away from my listening experience at all.
__label__2 Great Nail Trimmers: These work great and are nice and sharp. They have a safety stop so you dont cut too much. And they are nice to hold
__label__1 Horrible: This product I did receive fast but, the product itself was defective an skipped no sound. Subtitles were on. This was not what I was promised highly disappointed!!
__label__2 Get Ready for This Session: Their singles foreshadowed what a full length might bring and they sure do deliver with this instant classic. They can lyrically go toe to toe with anyone and the beats work well with their lyrics. They flip many different styles effortlessly and their versatility in styles match their versatility in their storytelling. A must have for any hip-hop fan. Actually, if you are a hip-hop fan, you should already have this album and shouldn't need someone like me to tell you to go out and get it!
__label__1 Quiltmaker: Found it very hard to get the iron to switch back on after it had shut off. The easiest way is to unplug and then plug in again which is time consuming.
__label__2 If you like Allende, you'll like this: Putting aside any issues I might have on a more critical level, the fact is that, like anything Allende writes, this book is a good read. If you want to be sucked into a story, she never fails.Unlike some, I found it refreshing to have such a great amount of detail on Zorro's childhood. For details on his exploits, there are plenty of other books and films available. What intrigued me was how he became who he was. I found the best part of this book to be the first section dealing with his parents and his birth. The enigma that is his mother and the place she has bridging the world of the Spanish and the indigenous, at least for a time, are what allow him to navigate his way through life later on.If you like Allende's narrative style, you'll like this book.
__label__1 A Teen's Guide to Christian Living: It doesn't seem to ring true....what is the story behind it??? Not a book I'd recommend for a daughter or granddaughter.
__label__1 Glad I read the reviews first.: Like many of the reviewers on this site; I too was hoping this would be the product to end the need for razors. Obviously, I would be making a huge mistake spending money on this product. Thank you all for your opinions.
__label__1 squeaker destroyed in 2 minutes: We thought a KONG toy would be a good choice for our labrador.The squeaker was gone in less than 2 minutes! Now we just havea tennis ball....
__label__1 Was not a good follow up: I finally played this all the way through after 12 years. and found that it's actually not just a bad collection of songs, but also a feeble attempt to do another "Operation Mindcrime". I guess the group felt since the show of the same name had moderate success that they'd try another, but the songs for the most part were not strong enough, and in a time when heavy metal was obsolete, and the music world was in mourning of the grunge scene after Kurt Cobain's death, so the musical identity for rock was in limbo pretty much, and this was not a good offering. I don't know if anything could've been considered a good follow up to "Empire" because in order to do so the group would probably have to reinvent themselves.
__label__1 Beware of Subscriptions: I liked the product; my daughter learned a lot. Now I am trying to cancel, because every time she uses it, our credit card gets charged $7.99. I had to search for how to cancel; the website says cancel by calling a long distance number (not an 800 number). The number has a long, long wait on it. I have better things to do with my time.Buyer, beware.
__label__1 Great Game, Terrible Sound Problem: I can't speak highly enough about the gameplay in Half-Life 2 and Portal. Phenomenal games. But the crackly sound problem is very real and very annoying. It happens way to often. I really can't believe how little EA / Valve care that they let this bug stay in the game and have not released a patch for it. The looong loading times I can deal with, but the sound problem really gets on my nerves.Is it still worth getting? Yes, but only if this is the only way you have of playing Half-Life 2 and Portal, and if you're prepared to restart the game often when the sound goes screwy.
__label__1 Could not get it to work soo I sent it back: Could not get it to work soo I sent it back. I had it for a month and talked to the Teck's 5 or 6 times and they could never get all the buttons to work. Would not reccomend it.
__label__1 Not good: Before watching this, I was debating whether MacFarlane was a genius. After watching this, I'm no longer debating the point. He's not a genius. Something about the nature of real action, as opposed to cartoons, exposed just how juvenile his humor is. Not funny.
__label__1 Not recommended: This is one of the worse books I have ever plodded through. I can't believe I actually finished it. It is full of rambling prose, and uninteresting characters, in a very boring, uneventful plot. Why would anyone want to write such a book? What is the point? Matteo and Sophie aren't very deep people, and the bit about the Mother was so uninteresting. It wasn't even worthy of one star and is in such contrast to books by the same author, that have a soul. Why would anyone want to write about this kind of indulgent, boring uninteresting people, even though I know their type exist? They aren't worthy to be characters in any literature.
__label__2 Really cute: The little ernie is so cute and my daughter loves telling him not to use 'too much toliet paper'. Good strong board book as well which is what every kid in this age group needs.
__label__2 Review for "Body of Secrets": I found "Body of Secrets" to be quite an interesting book about the NSA but there was one error that really, really bugs me. On page 402, the author states that DSD is headquartered at Victoria Barracks; on St. Kilda Rd in Melbourne.This is wrong: DSD moved to the western side of the Department of Defence complex at Russell Offices in Canberra during 1991 - 1992. It's new $A100 million building was opened in May 1992. The move completed the consolidation of the Australian Intelligence Community to Canberra.I was disappointed that the author didn't check his information. Other than that, I quite enjoyed the book.
__label__2 Best Baby Swing: My son loves this swing. He is 8 months old and has taken good long naps in it since we brought him home from the hospital. It is also great for Mom because baby is entertained in this swing by the mobile and the toy bar. So Mom has time to get a shower,do laundry, dishes ect. It is lightweight. I carry it from room to room with me. I am a first time Mom and this swing is the best baby item we have bought. If you are on a limited budget, this would be the one extra item I would buy.
__label__2 Great shaver for the money: It is quiet while powerful. I get consistently very close shaves. I am very happy with my model 8140XL.
__label__1 Great movie! Poor transfer: I love the movie but the quality of the transfer was very depressing at times. There were numerous points in the movie where the grainy speckled image looked like a copy from a video tape and not what you would expect to get from a Blu-ray presentation. The whole movie was not grainy, some of the scenes where quite good, but some left me wondering if all the footage was transferred from the same source. Still a great movie!
__label__1 Too Old, Too Late: A big disappointment, the artists doing this album. They're just too old and tired and they sound like it on this album. By the way I'm as old as they are but I know better than to try the same things in the same way, that I did when I was much younger.
__label__1 poorly done!: i just found this dvd annoying. The music attempts to evoke the feeling of a young trendy viewer, although the narrator sounds like Robin Leach. Most of the suggestions, boutique and hotel- wise are for tourists with 'beaucoup bucks' to spend, not very practical! This guide shows more of the inside of premises' than the outdoor scenery, and left me feeling empty. It does give you a nice 2-minute glimpse of the canal, street and park views but not nearly enough.
__label__2 creative labs Audigy SE: I bought this card when my on-board audio failed. I'm not a cutting-edge user, so this works fine for me.
__label__2 Get some good perspective: I can't believe that a young woman has written such a concise, thoughtful and intelligent book about the important issues that we never take the time to think about. The pages are rife with appropriate stories taken from the author's own life that vividly illustrate each point she is trying to get across. This is far from a preachy self-help book, it is valid in one's everyday life and will give you something to think about whether you are Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist or Atheist.
__label__2 This tool needs a Quick-Lok Power Cord!: Be aware that the picture above of a Magnum Style drill motor with the Quick-Lok power cord is NOT correct. The Model 0232-20 0-2800RPM does not come with a Quick-Lok cord although the Model 0224-1 0-1200RPM has the Quick-Lok power cord. What's up with that?I'm still going to purchase the Model 0232-20 because I need a high RPM drill but I'm also going to try to fit a Quick-Lok power cord to it. All the Magnum series drill motors seem to have the same plastic handle design so it might work.
__label__1 Tried to fool me once. It didn't work.: The hat was closer to a size 8 than the 7 3/8 size that I ordered. It absolutely did not fit my head and it was obvious that the original New Era tag had be cut off and replaced with a tag from this supplier. You cheated me and I should ask for my money back but I'd rather make people aware of this so they don't buy anything from you and get cheated like me. Your package was also 2 days late, yet the company delivering the package stated that it had got to my place on time, which it definitely did not. This was about my 6th or 7th time ordering a New Era Cap from Amazon.com and you were by far the worst. Get your act together or you'll get caught by the wrong person because your defiling a product that is not yours, which you know is illegal. Good riddens.
__label__2 needs outer box: product was just fine but delivery was not to my standards they left on my porch in view of street with original box so all could see luckily it was'nt stolen im in n.y. after all
__label__2 Enjoying the phones: I had ordered one for my husband a year ago because it had all the features he wanted. When I was in need of a new phone I read the reviews which were no longer favorable, but didn't have a problem with the phone set up and hanging up on people or the static when you are in close range of the base. Since I have ordered a second one for my home office - I have noticed static problems when I get to far from the base - but I know it's not a 900mhz phone and I didn't pay for that. The phone works great in my office and that's where I leave it - but I can walk around the upstairs of my home with it - no problems.
__label__2 Pictures Good; Romeo Is So Slow, He Needs Help For E.D.: I must be getting old. I have come to love this Romeo performance /// Previous review: The Mussorgsky Pictures is given a very inflected and dramatic performance. But poor Romeo is so slow in some passages, he needs that stuff you see advertised on TV with middle-aged guys on motorcycles, and lots of flowing water.
__label__1 Cuisinart CRC - 400 4 - Cup: I was really happy when I first (February 2010) purchased the rice cooker. For almost 18 months, it worked like a dream. Then teflon liner/bowl started to chip away, making the rice to stick to the liner bowl. Shortly after this, it started to burn the rice, finally it completely fried.I would not recommend this appliance to anyone who expects a long term solid appliance.Manufacturer's planned obsolescence.
__label__1 Stay away: What a waste. Megaphone does nothing, mask doesn't even come close to fiting and the strap goes around my son's neck. Overall a 25 dollar pile of junk.I'llnever purchase anything from Theo Klien again.
__label__2 Lighten-up: Ok.....so this isn't "Gone With The Wind", but who says every novel has to be. It's a quick, fun read with alot of action. It's a good break for a couple of hours.
__label__2 What a cool toaster: I've never had a toaster before, but I've had plenty of toaster-ovens. After we accidentally torched our last toaster-oven by keeping taco shells in it too long we tried a cheap toaster-oven which actually failed to toast. And here I was thinking toaster-oven technology is so simple and well-known they wouldn't be able to screw it up.So my wife convinced me to try a toaster, and we got this on seeing as it's somewhat mid-priced (no more budget appliances for me!) and it has several cool features - the high-lift lever and the bagel setting. As previous reviewers note, toasting a bagel on only one side makes all the difference.And of course, it just looks cool. We're hipper now that we own it and get invited to a lot more parties.I don't have anything bad to say about it.
__label__1 Not for 65" Panasonic Plasma TV: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE A 65" PANASONIC PLASMA TVI recently purchased this product for a 65" Panasonic Plasma TV I was mounting on a wall and the wall bracket is too small for my 65" tv. The bracket I need is 42" inches or more and the bracket that comes with this product is only 36" inchesGood thing I have another TV I needed a mount for so I will use it for that tv instead.I am going to give the Sanus VMPL3-B Tilt Wall Mount for 27" to 84" Displays (Black) a try since the wall bracket is adjustable.I was advised by the vendor to return the product and get my money back but no need. I have another television that needs a wall mount and I measured this bracket which fits just fine.Nothing against the vendor but they need to make sure they put a statement on there that says it will not work on 65" Panasonic Plasma TV's that require a bigger bracket than the one they sell which is only 36" in length.ThanksJ
__label__1 Good for a child: I wanted a book that would give me an overview of US Presidents. This was less information than I had hoped for. I think this would be a good addition to a young persons reference books....maybe get them interested in history. It doesn't have much data.
__label__1 Great Concept - Horrible Execution: My mother bought this for my [...] son. He loves the idea, but has a hard time getting it to work. The machine takes bills only about 10% of the time. It's extremely frustrating for him. Second, the bills and coins dump into one compartment. When you open the compartment to make a withdrawal, they all tend to spill out. If they improved both those problems it would be a great toy. As it is now, I would not waste my money on it.
__label__2 amazing art full of fun!: It is amazing and lots of fun! This book especially for beginners. A lot of stone painting project is explained step by step with pictures and patterns. I have already picked up a lot of stone and already have bought acrylic paints, i am starting my first project tomorrow! I beleive painting animals on stones will be very easy and amazing with this BOOK!
__label__1 Average Book, not bible: I was expecting more from a book called 'Bible'. For starters, this book is great but it is not for advanced users.
__label__1 EGR brand is much better quality: [ 4-piece set for 2005 Ford Freestyle]I've bought many sets of AVS visors over the years. Their quality has definitely gone down hill! The tint color is unattractive. The edges were not finished well. The surface had scuff-marks. And it took three sets to get one that didn't have a cracked visor, right out of the box!Fortunately, Lund International's customer Service is Superb! I guess they NEED to be.I ordered a set of EGR visors for my Nissan Titan at the same time. They were beautiful. At least twice the thickness as the AVS (where needed), no scuff-marks, smooth edges, installed in a couple minutes. Cost about $6 more! Nuff said!
__label__1 generic alterna rock = bad: ok, so there's a song that sounds a little like Third Eye Blind, there's a song that soounds a little like U2 circa joshua tree, there's a song with grungy guitar riffs a la Smashing Pumpkins. basically there's a lot of stale 80's and early 90's stuff here. i have one suggestion: throw away your chain wallets and gas station attendant jackets and join the 21st century. you guys were new like 10 years ago.
__label__2 Wow: I knew this game was going to be good, but I never imagined it would be as good as it is. The original Halo was good but it lost me after a few levels. This one is different. I'm doing about 5 levels a day. If you're a shoot-em' freak and you're thinking if you should buy this game I say you should definetly get it.
__label__2 A NEW TWIST: I really enjoyed reading Mr. Dickey's latest effort. Mainly, because you took us (me) down a different path. With the same results ... A Good Read!! I suggest this book to friends and to others that have yet to read this one (I have them all). You will not be disappointed.** I will admit I was thrown a little a first - by Dickey's new twist (style) but the more I read the more he pulled me in like always.Eric Jerome Dickey is # 1 in my book.
__label__1 Hi Dan. by Nicole B: I think that Maus was an informative book. Even though it was completely in comics, it told the story very well. I think that the book would have been better if it wasn't completely written in comics. Another thing that I didn't like about the book was the fact that it shows all of the characters as mice. This was confusing at times.
__label__1 This is NOT Shaolin Soccer!: This movie is a low budget waste of time, and NOT Shaolin Soccer. This is called Shaolin Family Soccer, see what they did there? Save your money for the real version.
__label__2 You need to get this: I didn't even know it came out. My sister sends me my birthday present (late), I open it and am just ecstatic!!! I loved this show when I was a kid. And I stayed up until 2:30 watching the night I got it. Still is a great show. Now I just can't wait for the second series to come out. I will be first in line to get it.The quality is very nice (except for the behind-the-scenes feature). Wish there were more extras (got spoiled by Star Wars). But this is definitely worth getting. Thanks Sis.
__label__1 Gasket for 4 qt. Mirro pressure cooker: Gasket wouldn't seal at all. Waste of time effort and money! Will not be ordering again.Gasket was way too narrow.
__label__2 "You can't handle the Truth": Even when he's not skewering that buffoonish blowhard, O'Reilly, Franken neatly nails his targets...deftly hitting the bullseye everytime, blowing it to smithereens...and, unlike the subjects of his ire, he does so with wit and grace, qualities completely foreign to them...guess that's why they resent him so much!
__label__1 An Empire Divided is an Apt Sub-title: Unfortunately, the division is between the cash paying customers, and the Sony / Lucas arts Bean Counters. I have been playing, and I cancelled my account as of last night, due to absolutely no customer service.There are many bugs and problems with this game, which is based on Star Wars only in licensing the names and sounds. Perhaps, if they actually finished beta, and released something that was 75 or 85% functional, it would be worth a glance at, but as it is, you are paying for no service, a great deal of boredom, a broken economy, broken gameplay, and very little to do with actual Star Wars.Two thumbs down
__label__1 Tryptophan 500 mg.: I DID NOT THINK THESE PILLS HELPED AT ALL, THOUGH OTHER BRANDS SEEMED TO. PILLS ARE ALSO HUGE, AND DOSAGE IS 3 CAPSULES.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
__label__1 They should told us that this is a product catalogue: Buyer beware. This is not a compilation DVD. This is actually a product catalogue. 75-80% of the performer didn't make it through the end of the song. Some lasts at the intro (the Billy Cobham's drum solo/intro, and they lists all the Cobham's band member that barely played any single not at all). Although the artists delivered incredible performances, I still really really totally dissapointed with this DVD. So, buy it only if you need a preview/catalogue of the TDK DVD products. Otherwise, a big NO...
__label__2 orchids in the moonlight.: Hi, yes I do agree that Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers are great together,but in my opinion in this film I just loved the dancing and the music by the dance troupe especially when they danced the tango to the tune orchids in the moonlight.WoW! what a tune so romantic.Delores Del Rio & Gene Raymond to me also made the film for me a hit.
__label__1 Eh...: A so-so book. Good for a light read on the beach, but if you're looking for something to actually stimulate your brain, you'd be better off with a different book. I personally didn't like it much.
__label__2 great piece of anime: This is a great story and well produced anime series. Not your typical crap that comes from the east pitched at prepubescent teen kids.
__label__1 What happened to I Don't Want To Wait?!!?: I Love dawson's creek as a show, but the theme song/opening credits is one of my favorite parts of each show. I am VERY disappointed that the theme song was changed in this DVD release. It is a stupid, stupid idea and I hope that it is returned to to I Don't Want to Wait for the 4th season release. If you like the show, buy the DVD, but you can count on being disappointed about the music!
__label__1 Does not work....: Horrible product. My husband tried it and it does not work. He went over the same place at least 10 times and it did not remove any hair. He tried to shave in the opposite direction and it just pulled his hairs out, which was very painful. Big waste of money. Would have given 0 stars if I could.
__label__2 Matt Costa is Amazing: This CD is actually amazing. You can't really categorize it into just one genre because it has it all. His songs are catchy and once you hear them, you won't be able to stop listening. If you're into acoustic tunes or like Jack Johnson, you definately should buy this CD!!!!
__label__1 Ugly Projects: I respectfully disagree with the other reviewers. I found nothing in this book that I would knit. The emphasis is on home decorating items, such as pillows. I sent it back the same day it came. Blessings to Amazon.com for a great return policy.
__label__2 I hope I get to meet Robert Fulghum someday...: What a great story-teller. I have listened to almost all of his books on tape and enjoyed every single one of them. I almost feel like I know him as my own personal friend just from listening to him on his books on tape. True Love was no exception. When I saw it on the shelf I HAD to get it and I wasn't disappointed.
__label__2 Great tips!: I thought this book was great! It provides tips for interviews, resumes and cover letters. It helped me to think about the interview process as a two way conversation. I should be interviewing the company just as they are interviewing me. The book was easy to read and very helpful to me when looking for my current job. I've passed the book around to friends too as a guide when searching for a new job.
__label__1 Only a synopsis of info already out there: I could have written this book by struggling through with installing and understanding Apache myself. In fact, by installing Apache and looking through the documentation, I knew most of what was in the book already. There was no unique information here, or unique solutions to real-world problems. I think this book may save you time in an emergency or in general, but beyond that it's a bit dissappointing. I think the publisher said, "O'K', let's get two guys, have them install Apache, and write a book about it." That's just my opinion, though.
__label__2 Improvement: This was able to comple my Ryobi BT 3000 table saw so that I can now use all the tradition fixtures and jigs on my saw.
__label__1 Disappointed: The other reviews touted this little, inexpensive radio as excellent. The old adage, when something sounds too good to be true applies in this case. This radio gets poor reception, is a flimsy, cheap portable radio, and is barely sufficient for stations with the strongest signal, providing poor audio quality. It probably cost Sony $1 or so to build and package and that's what it is really worth. I am keeping it in a draw as an emergency radio, but it is no bargain.
__label__1 Not his best: There's something funny going on with this music on this CD. It's as if the instruments are playing one thing and vocals are doing another. I've never done drugs, but somehow this makes me feel like I am - as if what I've read about taking LSD or some other type of hallucinogen is true. Perhaps that's what he was on when he recorded it. :-)
__label__1 Almost worth a view, but definitely not a purchase.: I purchased this title as part of the Amazon "Buy One Get One Free" offer on Blu-ray titles last month. I needed to pick up an extra disc, since there were only three I wanted, so I grabbed this.This movie was mediocre at best. It never really drew me in. In fact, I'd say it was borderline a waste of time. It's really a rip-off of "An Officer and a Gentleman", as well as about every 3rd low-budget boxing movie that has come out in the past few years.If I were in the Navy, I would probably be afraid people in the other services would laugh at me because of it.Pass on purchasing this one. Rent only if really bored, and you've seen everything else on the shelf.
__label__1 Boring!!!!!!!!!!!: Sorry E. Lynn fans but I couldn't even finish this one whew! Thank God I got it from a thrift store for $1.00.
__label__2 Good show.: I enjoyed watching this show. Some parts are very drawn out and could have been skipped in the series.
__label__2 Overall letter grade=A: I would rank this as one of King's best. I believe it was his second book and reflects a period of King's writing that is unique and had great integrity in terms of composition. Some of the imagery is extremely haunting, especially the dilapidated mansion on the hill that holds much terror for the story's main character. It's certainly the best vampire story ever. It takes Stoker's Dracula and cranks it up a few more grisly notches.
__label__1 Thought it would be good: I read about Cheyenne in Girls' Life magazine and thought "Wow! She sounds like she's a great singer!" So I borrowed the CD from my cousin. Her voice sounds funny and it sounds like her guitar wasn't tuned. I think, though, that she is a singer who will get better as she gets older.
__label__2 A heavy hitter: I'll keep this simple and to the point. The lens is bullet proof. It produces beautiful images even in low light situations and that's even hand held.Only one minor complaint, it's pretty heavy. I guess that's a small price to pay for beautiful photos and dependability. You get a bit of a work out, but who isn't in need of that.
__label__2 Where Munki Left Off...: This is an awesome album...it begins right where the 1998 Munki JMC album left off...and they also reworked a song from JMC...the b-side "Kissaround" but with the female vocalist from Munki (which most of these songs are sung)...go get it!!!
__label__2 slow paced but good: I didn't think I would like this book at first because I couldn't relate to Catherine at all. She seemed a little too upper class perfect at first. However, Gray was an absolute dream. In fact it was hard to believe that at the age of 32 nobody had snapped him up. Not very much history was given about Gray but since this is a Silhouette Romance and not War and Peace that's not that big an issue. I loved the interactions between Catherine and Gray and the slow build of the romance which culminated in some very steamy sex scenes! I also liked the fact there were no bad guys in this book. All in all this was a slow paced but likable book. I'm glad I read it.
__label__1 The American President: The DVD arrived on time but once I played it I found that the view I had of the movie seemed like a view looking through a small window frame placed in the middle of my TV screen. The actual size of the movie screen was much smaller than my TV screen and wasn't pleasant to watch at all. Amazon was happy for me to return the item and I did so. I've since ordered a new DVD from another vender on Amazon.
__label__1 BAD: I LOVE "Oju" but the other songs are not nearly as good. This album is a major dissapointment. I don't understand the hype about this trio here in Spain.
__label__1 too small: We tried this vest on 4 children and the only one that could wear it was our6 year old and she only weighs 55 lbs. The other three all weigh less than 75 lbs. and none of them could even get it on. This is a very poor discription on the actual vest and the children that it will fit. I would not purchase this vest for any child over 55 lbs.
__label__2 Excellent documentary: Great easy to understand documentary on the global financial crisis. Matt Damon was a great narrator and it is an easy to follow idiots guide on how it started and what eventuated and what was promised and just have never been acted on. Highly recommended.
__label__2 hank william is the best singer that ever lived.: in my book hank williams is the top in all of music. this record is one of his best. he just tells it likeit is.
__label__1 Sit & Spin Review: What a piece of junk! I bought it with the idea that my children would be able to enjoy the same toy I had as a child. This toy would not spin, and is built to fall apart! Don't buy this product unless you are ready for disappointment
__label__1 Beautiful watch, but not resistant @ all!: This watch was given to me as a gift. My grandmother bought it at Zales, and it was pre-owned, 1st of all, they didn't tell her it was pre-owned. I checked the ticket because the steel around the sphere was scratched. When we went back to the store to exchange it, she bought me a new one, I wore it right then, and at the end of that very same day (I wore it for like 2 hours), it already had two scratches! And all "physical action" I did was drive (if you can call that a "physical action"). I really do take good care of it, I wanted it to last years because it is a gift; now I don't know if maybe it'd be better to return it! When I went to exchange it, I couldn't exchange it for another model because I just fell in love with the Amorosa model, but what's the point of having a beautiful watch if you know that in tops, 1 year, all of its stainless steel will be scratched and unshiny...
__label__2 Don't use fast shipping, but book was in good shape.: The book took a week to get to me, but it was in good shape -- 5 star service, if not for the shipping time. I would buy from them again!
__label__1 Disappointed: Before purchasing this game I read several reviews, but despite several mentioning the controls were difficult I wanted to try it anyway. The graphics on this game are pretty good and the story is interesting, but the controls were indeed an issue. The majority of the game takes place in flight and you control your dragon but tilting and moving the sixaxis controller. Unfortunately, the dragon does not always respond in time to execute your move, and sometimes it doesn't respond at all. Most notably when dodging or trying to do the '180' manuever. Additionally, your dragon is much slower than the enemies you are fighting. I enjoyed the game at first, but as the missions became more difficult the sluggish controls became more of an issue, to the point that playing the game became more aggravating than enjoyable.
__label__1 Bad batch?: After the first one didn't work in a Canon 60D, it was exchanged for another which Amazon was kind to do. This one has only lasted a year and not used that much. Unhappy that a $ 77.88 SD card lasted only a year.
__label__1 packaging: did not come in original package, but seemed to be opened and not by us. The sheets still do not fit the bed.
__label__1 Lasted a little over a year then ....: This unit worked OK after purchasing but was not good at all refrigerating items (always luke warm). After a little over a year, the unit started making noises when the refrigerator tried to cool and then it started leaking like crazy. I finally go a hold of Soleus tech support (totally useless!) and they basically told me that it was probably cracked or the tubes (still don't know where these are!) disconnected somehow although the unit was never moved since I got it! After reading all the reviews here, I would NEVER recommend this cheaply made product!
__label__2 response to Matt Atkinson..is this book useful for teens?: As the author of the book and a parent of teens, I can confidently tell you that teens DO read the book and benefit from it. Several teens (one boy and one girl) ended relationships which they discovered to be controlling after reading parts of it. Therapists who work with teens at my agency use it all of the time and cannot keep the book in stock.I would advise directing them to certain sections...particularly examples of warning signs as those sections resonate. I hope that this helps.
__label__1 Bitter, party of one? Your table's ready.: Don't bother with Myrna Blyth's poorly-written, ill-conceived, right-wing rubbishing of the few American women who have managed to make names and careers for themselves in what is still, sadly, a man's world. Instead, go straight to the source: St. Jerome's medieval anti-woman diatribes. If you don't happen to read Middle English, never mind -- at least you won't have wasted your time on Blyth's self-pitying, middle school musings about how those popular girls are secretly really, really hateful.
__label__1 Turning Away: If you want to hear the original, most brilliant version of the song "Turning Away", type in Dougie MacLean's name and check out his CD "Indigenous" - you WON'T be disappointed. Mary Black's version is WEAK!! Sorry Mary!
__label__2 A great snack....: This book is a great snack to tide us over until the next installment. We finally get to hear Micah's story and get a terrific new possible surprise and plot development. My only complaint is that it went too fast. Fantastic!
__label__2 Great Price for the value: This smart cycle bike is very funny for children to ride and the games that they have to go with it are very good and helps to motivate the child to be both active and educated at the same time.
__label__2 great watch: This is a high quality watch and is very stylish. The face is rather large so if you have a small wrist look for something else.
__label__2 I'm a Believer: I got turned onto Rhett Miller from Paste magazine. Included a disc featuring a song from this album. I bought "Instigator" first and it took a few listens, but it grew on me with many great songs on it. Bought "Believer" and feel it's equally as great if not better with some more upbeat music jangles. Still shares the same haunting lyrics about love, life and the feelings once expressed and so on. Really great CD and unlike Instigator, I found myself listening to Believer and singing out loud.
__label__1 Completely outrageous!: You've got to be kidding me! Could this be any more Orwellian??? "Fostering a dispositon for activism" is one of the topics in this book. The classroom is a wholly inappropriate place to be indoctrinating young children in questionable leftist rhetoric and activism. Many parents would be agahst if they knew their children were being recruited as the next generation of protesting myrmidons.
__label__1 Whats all the fuss about?: I was certain this was going to be a lifesaver but I've realized its not. I mostly just use it for flashlight mode.In the beginning when your baby is eating every 2-2.5 hours, you'll know when your baby is hungry. You'll also likely remember when they went to sleep and when you changed their diaper.I dont know if maybe this is more useful if you have multiples? Just not sure why everyone thinks you need it.
__label__2 serves its purpose: I bought this for my grandson, when he sleeps over and it serves its purpose. In all fairness it is not used much but thats why I like the feature that you can hide it easily under the bed. It has easily fitted both a queen and twin and been moved, but its somewhat hard to slide the clamps under a larger mattress. Minutes to assemble. I like the fact that you can slide it down and hide it under the mattress. Extra long for those kids that roll around in bed. The only negative is that its somewhat "wobbley" and not as sturdy as I had thought. Also the metal fold down elbows protrude from the mattress. I cover them with a down comforter for safety purposes. For $28.00 it does the job.
__label__2 Great Movie, Great Features, Horrible Disc: I loved almost everything about this Blu-ray release. The weird cover, the special features I never thought I'd get. Both commentaries are amazing.However, this release was marred for me by the glitchy disc itself. The menu shows everything twice, is hard to navigate and the disc locks up on me frequently causing me to have to restart it.But, all in all, I am very happy with this release.
__label__1 Hertitage Farms Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder: Heritage Farms "Squirrel Proof" Bird Feeders are anything but! To be remotely squirrel proof it must be in an area where squirrels cannot get onto it from any location. This means it has to be at least 10 ft from any structure, tree, bush or pole. That means it has to be pole mounted and you will then need a baffle to prevent them from climbing up the pole. The springs on the outside of the feeder provide a place for the squirrels to hang on as well as the sharp corners that they can grasp. I have tried modifying this feeder several different ways and they still can manage to hang on and eat from it. Forget all forms of this feeder and go with the Homestead Super Stop-a-Squirrel Feeder, it really is squirrel proof!
__label__1 Walk Three Moons?: This is the worst book I have ever read. Absolutely no actionwhat so ever. All it is, is a waste of time...Walk two moons?Doesn't make any sense if i were to rate this book in a scale 1-10, Iwould pick -10 no questions asked... This is so boring you will have nightmares. Just a terrible book simply. END
__label__2 Astroid: It has Michael Biehn in it so it is great - did see it on TV (and taped it) and wanted it without commercials also.
__label__2 You'll never make it as a successful artist today without seeing these DVDs: Like i said in the title, these DVDs are essential to an up and coming artist. Being able to see how an artist works and thinks in the 20th century has changed the way i work and think. If you are an artist or an art historian and you havnt seen this series, then you need to. If you are an art professor, show this to you students it will be one of the greatest things you ever do for their career.
__label__1 I guess this confirms it..: punk is dead, or close to it. All this mainstream crap is over-shadowing the 'real' music. I dont know how this is called punk.. its pretty sad when the most 'rebelious' song is one about 'putting your hands up'. To all you 10-year olds who like them, try lisening to NOFX, Bad religion, Ramones or Green Day. Leave it to MTV to find a way to sell these kinds of records..
__label__1 Is it as bad as they say?: In a word YES. I went to see this movie to see if it was as bad as everyone said. I figured with the big name stars that it could't be, but I was wrong. It seems to start out fine and I wanted to like it but soon the bad dialog begins to stand out. After about 20 minutes I kept waiting for "Come on Guys. Let's cut em off at the pass" It got to be where the characters seemed to get confused as to how to place the emphasis on the words making for the feeling of "What did they say?"The plot wasn't too bad but it was as if some of the scenes came from a different movie. Some scenes would go on forever and others would end before you could figure out what there purpose was.Is this the worst movie of the year? Possibly not, but if you really have to see it then wait until it's been out on video for a while so you can rent it cheap.
__label__2 Excellent for novice or expert: I have always been fascinated by toby mugs and jugs, but could not find the right source of information. This is one of the best reference books ever. I use it daily to help identify toby and character mugs and jugs. I was very lucky to get an advanced copy of it's companion price guide. The combination of the two has proved to be very useful. I would recommend these two publications highly!
__label__1 Avoid the kindle version: My one-star rating refers to the Kindle version only, because the content of the text is decent.The three problems with the Kindle are these: 1) You don't get the CD, without which it is extremely difficult to capture the right sound and timing; 2)Some pages of musical notation cannot be enlarged enough to read, even on my 24" monitor, and 3) You can't print any of the pages in order to make them legible.My advice is to buy the printed version, and wait for the mail.
__label__1 This is Handel, not Donizetti!: She ruins the great opera by using bel canto ornaments. This is not to the true Handel style. And besides that, her voice is so shrill that it gives me a headache. Look elsewhere for great Baroque sing...Renee Fleming's Alcina.
__label__1 CD music: The CD arrived in like new shape and therewere no problems playing the music. Nothingwrong with the seller, would purchase from again.I found that beyond the hit song I did not enjoythis artist but this a personal preference and donot hold the seller responsible.
__label__1 E-400: don't buy from this seller...you won't receive anything, just a lots of emails.This people show no respect
__label__1 Simply awful: This movie was horrible, it's attempts at being the least bit frightening were laughable. I'm sorry to say that I wasted money on going out and watching it. It might make a good rental but that's about it.I don't think I will be renting it though or recomending it to friends.
__label__1 Not satisfactory for what they're capable of:: Once again, Queensryche is attempting to write a genre of music where in they have no business doing it. They are possibly the most talented band in the world, when they write what they're good at. This album is average for any band to write, muchless Queensryche. It has some good riffs and tunes, but where are the solos? Where are the guitar melodies? Where are Geoff's high vocals? I know it's not the 80's or 90's anymore, but I wish it were so Queensryche would be comfortable writing solid music!
__label__2 Awesome movie: This is undoubtedly the best action movie I have ever seen. Aside from the fact that the plot is a little lacking, the scenarios that Jason Statham has to get his way out of are extremely interesting. The fact that I have never seen this guy makes it evem more thrilling, since I don't think of him as another character (eg, Jackie Chan in "Who am I", I always think of that movie when I see him), I think of Stratham as the Transporter. My friends decided that they didn't want to see this movie after they saw Stratham blocking a missile with a tea tray in the preview--I've convinced them to see it once it comes out, since this was cut from the final version. The fighting is top-notch, the camera work is excellent, and the music is top-notch. My favorite action movie of all time.
__label__1 More of the same: This book is more of the same junk she writes but worst because it lacks originality. I would not purchase or read any more of her work. I don't recommend her work to anyone.
__label__2 Sorcerer: I first saw this movie in a theater when I was a boy. It blew meaway. The suspence is gripping. Thirty years later, it stillholds up. William Friedkin was at his peak with The Exorcist,The Fench Connection, and this movie. Anybody who likes actionwith thought will like this.
__label__2 Tangy for Fall: I tried it today at lunch and it's a little sour. Feels good, because I think its made up of green apples. Try it for fall, you Amazon customers. Its tangy and perfect.
__label__2 QURAN-GOD's final warning to the world: In The Name Of GOD, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.Glory be to God, Lord of the universe. Rashad Khalifa's authorized translation of the Quran is full of proof that GOD truly DOES EXIST. How? you ask...well these proofs I am refering to are in the form of the mathematics. Over it is nineteen (74:30). This verse provides the first physical proof of the Quran's Greatness. The WHOLE QURAN is mathematically coded with this awesome formula. (For More Information About This Miracle See Appendix 1 Of Dr. Rashad Khalifa's translation of God's FINAL TESTAMENT, THE QURAN).I always believed in GOD, the One and ONLY Supreme Being. Yet, this mathematical Miracle was enough for me to asure myself of such a FACT.Peace be upon you.
__label__2 One of the best Greatest Hits collections: This greatest hits collection is chalk full of hits from a great artist. Included is songs we all know, "Physical", "I Honestly Love You", "Twist Of Fate", the Grease songs, the Xanadu songs (including my personal fav ONJ song "Magic"), and of course her early work which ventured in to country. My only complaint about this cd is the exclusion of her work from her late 80's attempted comeback album The Rumour. "The Rumour" (written by Elton John and features him on backing vocals) and "Can't We Talk It Over In Bed" are 2 quality songs which should have been included her instead of the Grease Megamix.Overall, die-hard and casual fans of Olivia will enjoy this cd, you'll find all the hits you know and may even find songs you didn't know but will grow to enjoy (as I did with "Sam", "Have You Never Been Mellow" and "Please Mr. Please"), this is one of the best greatest hits collections I've ever purchased.
__label__2 The Joshua Tree Vinyl: One of the best albums, no doubt, an lp that a collector could not miss. Recommended with more than 5 stars.
__label__2 THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM OF INCREDIBLE SONGS.: I LOVED THIS ALBUM. ALL THE SONGS STICK IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO THE CD FOR HOURS. THIS IS A GREAT EASY LISTENING CD. YOU'LL LOVE THIS CD SO GET IT!
__label__2 Sublime: When dictionaries allow audio examples for the meanings of words, this recording would be perfect for the entry under "sublime".
__label__2 A Must Read!!!: As a "well intentioned" mother of three internationally adopted teenagers, this book honestly articulates difficult racial issues our children face. Our children do not automticaly inherit our white identity and associated privileges - and they know it!
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Money: Buy his back catalog, instead. All of it. This is just A&M exploiting a contract provision to harvest demand that was unforeseen when they dropped him. In general I like A&M, and until "Into The Mystery" I've always thought Wilcox' best work was on his three CDs with this label. But the fact remains that if you dig Wilcox, you'll want the whole set anyway, and if you don't, why put money in the pockets of a label that didn't have the foresight to recognize how valuable this artist is?I think you have to reward good will where it manifests, and a warmed-over compilation by a label that tossed him away just as he was turning an important inflection point in his career is not good will by any measure.
__label__2 Kitty Calender: I was impressed on how fast my product got to me, usually sites like this take much longer (because of 911)I will definately but from you guys again :-D
__label__1 Sacred Stone: How Cussler could lend his name to this worthless "novel" is a mystery to me. No suspense, no character development, disjointed editing, predictable plot add up to an absolute snoozer. I finished it out of incredulity that it could get progressively worse, but it did.I have read everything else Cussler has written, but am now going to be on guard for these " name cash cows".Avoid this one.
__label__1 A real mess.: I'm glad I didn't buy this from Amazon, because I saved myself the cost of sending it back by mail. The first page I looked at contained two glaring errors. While the sheer volume of statistics is impressive, what good are they if you can't trust them? I found this book to be inaccurate and full of sloppy fact-finding. It even contradicts itself! The author is obviously quite proud of his accomplishment, which is touching, but there is no excuse for errors in statistics and other matters of record.
__label__1 DISAPPOINTED!!: VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK. NOT ENOUGH DETAIL FOR KIDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PARTS OF THEIR BODY CAN NOT AND SHOULD NOTBE TOUCHED BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS; AND ALSO WHO CAN NOT ANDSHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES TO TOUCHTHEM. THE BOOK WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. WISH I COULD GET ARFUND ON THE BOOK!!
__label__1 It was a bad idea for them to change the formula!: I used this product for years and often received compliments on my long, healthy hair. Now they have a "new" version of this conditioner and my hair is always frizzy and full of static. Even my husband has noticed that this new product does nothing good for my hair. I really miss the old version and wish they would bring it back. Until they do, I'll be looking for another product. I would love to let the company know my thoughts, but I could not find any place on their website to do such a thing. Therefore, I am sharing my thoughts with everyone in the hopes that they will get the message.
__label__2 Great Thing to Have: This electric kettle is great. 1.7 liters is more than plenty of water and it boils quickly and easily. The kettle is simple to use and very effective. My only complaint is that the cord is a little on the short side (at least for my preferences), but this really isn't that much of a problem as you can always unplug it if need be. Overall, this is a great choice if you're looking for a good electric kettle.
__label__1 Readings May Be Inaccurate: The monitor is well constructed and user friendly. I got Serial No. 5Y31917LF which turned out to be inaccurate when measuring blood pressure. Readings are much lower than reality. Before you rely on this monitor, compare readings with an instrument known to be accurate. Since it failed at its intended job, I give it one star.
__label__1 Lassitudes: I had always wanted to read this book when I first heard about it. And it took me a while to get it. Because I have always liked the actor Will Patton from way back. But there is only one word to describe my experience with this booklet, and that is "weird".
__label__2 I was sceptical: Read alot of the reviews on this and was a bit nervouse to buy it. I did buy two, one for me and one for a friend, and we both love them! I've only had it snap off twice and that was becuase i was carrying a laundry basket on my hip. Other than that it's in great condition and works wonderfully
__label__1 I never got it!:-(: Due to my Mail Man and the post office I never got it because there was never a tracking number available and my post office didn't have no information on it!!!!I really wanted to see it too because I like Trina! I really never have problems with Amazon.
__label__2 GTA:Vice City: This is one of the greatest games of all time. Parents, be warned: this game has extreme violence and shows lots of gruesome blood. It also has prostitutes, strippers, pole dancers, and naked women. This is not a game for children. In this game you can do cool stuff like steal cars kill cops and and beat up hookers. If you are old enuff or mature enuff to play this game you should get it. It is worth getting an Xbox for this game alone. The only Xbox game that is better is Halo but not by much.
__label__2 Almost perfect: So far our family has only tried a couple of recipes. Must confess it took me a bit longer than 30 minutes, but both were easy to prepare and very tasty. My only criticism is that the recipes rather routinely call for 2 pounds of meat to serve 4. Half a pound of meat is simply not healthy and I worry that people will get the idea that if Rachael calls for it, it must be a good thing to do. BTW, simply reducing the amount of meat isn't a good solution, since the balance may get wildly thrown off.
__label__1 not next level, nothing special here: They tout that this is the next level energy drink. It is basically caffeine and sugar. That is it! Where is the next level? In the hip world of energy drinks, you have to stand out with those sorts of phrases, but this drink offers very little to stand behind the words. It does taste good, but other than that, it is lame. Low caffeine, small 8oz can, very few vitamins and/or herbs.
__label__1 Worst Porter Cable Product Ever: I have a lot of Porter Cable tools and have reccomended Porter Cable to a lot of people. I have their routers, circular saws (older versions), biscuit joiner, nail guns and a lot more. I bought this sander a few months after they came out. It is the worst tool ever made. They need a better design for holding the profiles. I have used it 3 times and it sanded good as long as the profile didn't fall out. I have decided to use the profiles without the vibrator. I hope someone will come up with a manual type profile sander that you can grasp easier than the little profiles. I wish I would have given it back to the manufacturer, but I have had it too long. I would not reccomend this to anyone unless you want to use the profiles manually.
__label__1 doesn't fit!: the QC and tolerances of this terminal are horrible. while the design is solid, i also had a loose terminal. the circumference is too large for the terminal and too small for use of shim, which i shouldn't have had to resort to anyway. no amount of tightening will allow it to clamp properly. tried on two different batteries. will use as a piece of scrap metal for my floor jack.
__label__2 Underpants: This book is really good and I think every one should read it. It is well suited for ages six and up .It would put you in a good mood because Captain Underpants makes you laugh. His job is to save people and get people out of trouble. He is like a comical superman.
__label__1 NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: this movie is worthless it is so boring and long like the spirit even though i like DC comics this one is to watch out for. this is the worst comic movie ive seen this year
__label__2 I cried and laughed and fell in love................: This author is brilliant and very creative and I'm going to read every last one of her books!J.R. Ward has done an outstanding job with this story. I laughed in so many parts where the characters remarks were so to the "T" of what they would have said. I cried in so many parts for the love that J.R. Ward puts into her characters. I'm so happy there are so many more books of this series because I just can't put them down.
__label__2 GREAT WORK FROM BEYONCE!: NO MATTER HOW EVERYONE IS HATING ON HER,SHE IS ONE OF THE MOSTSUCESSFUL YOUNG ARTISTS IN THE INDUSTRY,AND NOT TO FORGETTALENTED AND CREATIVE. AS FAR AS THIS ALBUM IS CONCERNED,IDIDN'T EXPECT FOR IT TO BE AS GOOD AS IT IS. SHE CAME OUT WITHA STYLE DIFFERENT FROM DC'S SOUND WHICH MAKES IT TOTALLY OFFTHE HIZZY! I LIKE THE WHOLE ALBUM WHICH I GIVE 5 STARS FOR,BUTBABY BOY,HIP HOP STAR AND CRAZY IN LOVE I GIVE 1 STAR...I'M NOTFEELING THOSE SONGS,OTHER THAN THAT THE ALBUM IS GREAT,MATURE,SEXY AND SULTRY.
__label__2 Excellent service from Icy DVD: Icy DVD replaced a defective DVD immediately, with as little disruption as possible. They are an excellent, customer satisfaction guaranteed, company.
__label__1 i don't get all the hype: I saw these guys open for the Cure and they were really good. but thats it... i've since heard these guys on the radio (my little sister plays that same damn song over and over and over... dude, enough!) and seen the videos. okay, they're....alright. his voice is more or less talking over the music so duran duran comparisons i think are unwarranted. however, i discoverd this band called Longwave. if you like these guys, check them out. the singer is way better and the sound is very similar.
__label__2 Nice!: This fits our drawer beautifully. Makes our new stainless steel utensils look nice! Thanks for great product! This was a great find And a great price!
__label__1 Wave On: I own the originalSuperStar Professional 1-inch Flat Iron Hair Straightener, which I just love! However, I live overseas and unfortunately had removed the voltage safety of the product so I didn't want to plug it in and have a melt down! I bought this Black Pearl because it specifically said 220 volt, well that's about the only thing it has going for it. It works marginally, it's build quality is low, made of cheap plastic with low quality plates that aren't set properly and there is no heat setting. Finally, it looks converted to 220 that's how cheap it looks. So you are still wondering, well how does it function? My hair has but a few loose curls, that end up looking like loose, long waves. Tsk, tsk, it did little to nothing for my hair, which needs only a little heat and effort to go straight or curl the ends. For the price you should expect a better quality item with at least a high/low heat setting that actually affects your hair.
__label__2 Excellent addition to standard RF circuit design books: If your just starting in the field ofRF design it is better to start off witha more basic RF text book. I found this moreindepth book an excellent addition to my librarywith lots of real world circuit examplesand up to date references. Itcontains a glossary explaining everysymbol. Basically everybody in my designgroup wants to borrow it from me.
__label__2 good but not great shaver: I have owned several norelco cool skin shavers. They all work reasonably well. They lifespan though is very short. Maybe 1 year. 7775X has a lot more bells and whistles but its motor is not strong enough to completely shave my neck. I actually use a blade to completely remove my beard. However, the gel eliminates irritation.
__label__2 Best Jung book for the layperson: This book was written with the layman in mind, the book examines the average person's need to find his soul. All of the ideas in this book are still as valid as they were when the book was first written. But the need for this book is more than ever.
__label__2 Nice Case: A very nice hard case. Has plenty of room for any accessory you want to take with you. Fits easily into an average sized bag. I use it everyday to take my Zune to work.
__label__1 National Book Award? Are you kidding me?: This was absolutely awful. None of the characters are well developed, so you really don't care about them at all. It's just a series of short little scenes about people getting killed or tortured in explicit, gory detail, alternating with people having sex or masturbating in explicit, gory detail. I only finished it because I was on a plane with nothing else to read.
__label__2 Mixed Chicks Leave In Coniditioner Review: Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner 10 fl oz (300 ml)My hair is thick and curly and the Holy Grail for me has been to find a product that controlled the frizz, defined the curl and left it soft and shiny. My previous trials with leave in conditioners left my hair with a dull matt look.With Mixed Chicks all that is over. I feel this is a range that really speaks to my needs.Thank you Mixed Chicks!
__label__1 Game runs fine, but why the hype?: First of all, to adress a previous reviewer: I have Windows XP and I've had zero problems running the game. It takes a bit to start up, but the gameplay itself is fine.However, after listening for years to all the hype about Everquest, I'm very disappointed. I find this game to be really boring. I just don't see what the fuss is about.
__label__2 USEFUL ITEM, NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE AT BRICK AND MORTAR: HAPPY TO LOCATE THIS ITEM FOR MY CLASSES. THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE AT A BRICK AND MORTAR. WOULD USE THIS SELLER AGAIN.
__label__2 Great for iphone 3G: This is a great carrying case for the iphone 3G. I have looking for something like this for a while. Most are very expensive. This is right for the price.
__label__2 Phantom of the Opera 2 disk dvd: Stupendous! The music is fantastic. Each time I see it I fall in love all over again.
__label__1 This sucks!: This doesn't even deserve a star it's so bad. I have been a Rod Stewart fan since the beginning and this is the worst cd I've ever heard. First off, two of the songs are NOT Rod Stewart, I have no clue who they are but they are NOT him. The rest of the songs sound like he is singing into a garbage can. It sounds like someone recorded this off the radio using a kids tape recorder. Even the cover looks fake. It isn't like a normal cd would be, it's printed off a computer with no info on the inside at all. It looks like a bootleg copy that someone recorded themselves.
__label__1 Possibly Rice's worst: The one redeeming quality this book has is the development of Lestat. The plot left very much to be desired. The book rivals Lasher for my worst of Anne Rice pick. Unfortunately, it is a must read for the rest of the Vampire Chronicles. Fortunately, Tale of the Body Thief makes the time worthwhile.
__label__1 It Has To Be Seen And Heard To Be Disbelieved: The dialogue, the set design, the "performances," the plot development - What blender did it all come out of? Who sat in the screening room and thought, "Hey! The kids will love it!" It's almost as obscure and illogical as most of the performance art that I've seen. They must have had a suicide hotline installed on the set. This was shown on TCM as part of their "Underground" series, along with "Roller Boogie" on the same night. See it if you dare, or if you're a well-mannered drag queen who wants a laugh at someone else's expense.
__label__1 Copy Cat: This book was just like all those other "growing up books for teens". I have to give it some credit for having information, but the text was very small and the book was kind of confusing.
__label__2 Great!,,,,: Many to pick from.Never had so many narrow choices liked the Robert zur too they are sooo softAnd comfy
__label__1 Downright Creepy: A big man calling for a young boy to come take a ride with him in the middle of the night, and the kids goes?Sorry folks ... I found this book very creepy and not something I would read to my child.
__label__2 Excellent Wireless Router: I bought the WR850g 6 months ago. The user's manual is well written, and it is easy to set up. The security options include WPA and mac address control. It has worked flawlessly with my OSX Powerbook and WinXP laptop. The security protocol set up is a little confusing, and the manual needs more examples. You should also check Motorola's website for firmware updates.
__label__2 Very Satisfied - Great Product, Great Price!: ***** These Memorex DVD-R's deserve all 5 stars in my opinion. I waited before writing a review until I had used several. I have less than twenty left and had only one coaster out of the whole spindle of 100 so far. 99% is fine with me. I don't expect another dud in this batch. It works fine with my computer's dvd-burner. It's set to burn as fast as possible, and that's that.
__label__1 How can you be so close and fumble the ball????: All of the press on this book is the only reason I read it. I already have my opinion of President Reagan and his Presidency. I have read several other books about Reagan, liberally and conservatively biased, and Dutch was by far the most ignorant of them all. I repect what Reagan did for America. But the whole purpose of this book is to smear Reagan and leave a lasting black-mark on his legacy. Who paid off Mr. Morris? I am not a biographer. However, if I had all of the access and time that Mr. Morris had, I could have written everyone a 10 thousand page encyclopedia set. What an absolute waste!
__label__1 This book didn't help us navigate Paris at all: I purchased this book because of all the rave reviews, and after the experience of trying to navigate Paris with it, felt I owed it to future travelers to give my input. This book was fine to read on the plane trip over, and the plane trip back, but if you are looking for a book to guide you through Paris pick up a different guidebook. The pictures were nice, but messy. The maps were awful. Cross referencing with other books was impossible.
__label__2 This book rocks!: This book has opened up a whole new world for me and my husband. We take it with us everywhere we go around the state, even when we are just visiting relatives, and we go see the waterfalls the author has described in the local area. The book covers the entire state of CA and we've found beautiful waterfalls in places we would never have expected. We love to hike, bike, and camp, and this book has really accurate descriptions that get us where we want to go. The author's comments are also really fun to read.
__label__1 Horrible!: A few things to begin:1: I know this was the only SW novel in 78.2: How did this author win any SF award?So, I read through this book and by page 83 was convinced that Leia and Luke were two little children who constantly bickered and would lack the intellect not to get into a mud fight in the precarious situation they were in.THIS book is utterly unbelievable. I thought I was sitting in on a 1978 D&D; game!The writing is impossibly immature. Along with petty infighting and Leia's YOU KNOW WHO I AM lines (like that is going to scare big burly miners on an imperial controlled planet????) mixed with a few WORDY paragraphs and that just about sums up this novel.AVOID THIS NOVEL if this is your first venture into the expanded universe! Not all the SW novels are great ore even good, but the worst of the post 78 novels make this novel look like a bedtime story written by a child.
__label__1 You have to be joking?: This book is a joke? Maybe.Maybe not. I think it is. I have lived on the Island, and never heard of any of the tales within this book. The author wrote or made up most of what is in it. The stories are false or taken out of context. I can't understand why anyone would want to publish false information like this.
__label__1 Dissapointed: This is the SAME game as FFX (The previous version). ALL the maps are the same and all the world map is basicly a rip off of the old game with chicks wearing funky clothes. Where is what's his face? Anyway, The cool thing is the battle mode fights are MUCH faster and you can control the speed. There are many cool costume changes and junk. All in all, This game SUCKS! Don't BUY it. Unless of course you a die hard fan, then maybe you like wasting your life in front of it. I give this game 1 star only because the disk would NEVER read and I kept getting errors. It's BRAND NEW and it doesnt work? I think it's my system is messed up more than the NEW game. Thanks Amazon.
__label__2 Great Hammer Drill: This is a great VSR hammer drill, with selectable hammer function. Meaning you can use it as a regular 1/2 VSR drill or choose to engage the hammer for masonry. I was able to drill holes in brick and block very quickly and easily. Great drill.
__label__2 GENIOUS - PURE GENIUS! - BONHAM CARTER!!!!!!!!: This IS HELENA BONHAM CARTER's show! She gives us a total 3 dimensional Queen - with the "haps" and "sads" and "funnies" with just a little touch of Better Davis? Perhaps the rings, the wig, something very next.DEPP is great as the Hatter - but the accents confuse - sometimes Scots, sometimes North Country.I loved the small touches on Hatter - bloodied finger - too many sewing needles - the thimballs .....COLLEEN ATWOOD's realization of the costumes are always picture perfect - down to the fabric ....... important doing period work.HATHAWAY, MIA W., GLOVER, the rest of the ensemble fit perfectly - this is what Carol intended us to see ...... including the dark sides ....... the moat with the heads.Tiny touch of "OZ" - but Alice came before "OZ" - so maybe its the reverse.THIS MUST be seen in IMAX - you have to be IN the picture.Fave? CHESHIRE CAT natch.Great music by Elfman - touches of Glass ... but that's to be overlooked.
__label__2 Best CD of the GRP Collection: This Christmas Collection was recommended by a friend and colleague when I asked about recommended jazz Christmas music. This cd, the first in the collection, is certainly the best volume. I ordered it not only in CD but also in vinyl which I intend to gift to friends of our for their holiday party. Overall, I would highly recommend this cd. I am certain it will be a staple this December as we get in the Christmas spirit.
__label__1 Interesting tid-bit for the fawning masses: How many of you know that Jordan's editor at Tor happens to be his wife? Hmm, strange coincidence, eh? He's the cash cow for the company, so it's no surprise he keeps pumping out books in this series. Tor is letting him run wild, with no editorial control.Give him another editor who will force him to pare his books down by 100,000 words per book, at least.Otherwise, this book barely moves the story forward. I suggest folks read Martin, Kay, Sean Russell, Glen Cook or Robin Hobb for good fiction that has a beginning, middle and end.
__label__2 Great!: I bought this for my fiance for his birthday and he loves it! I would definitely recommend it for die hard Rob and Big fans!
__label__1 Completely unreliable: It's noisy, it's unreliable, and on a brand new battery you can get maybe 45 minutes of life. Oh yeah, and there are absolutely zero accessories for it, from Compaq or anyone else. Want an airline adapter for cross country flights? Too bad.So far my machine is 11 months old and I've replaced the power brick, combo drive, floppy drive, and multiport wireless. The case is mysteriously cracked and the keys stick. By contrast the 5 other laptops I've used over the years all work perfectly still, so I really doubt it's me.Since my last HP product was a LaserJet 3100, probably their worst product ever, I think this will be the last I buy from either HP or Compaq...I'd avoid them at all costs.
__label__1 Rocket fishing rod........................: I gave this 1 star because they don't allow 0. this thing is junk. only shoots 15 to 20 ft. the reel is very weak. me and my 4 year old used it for 2 hours and then it broke. the reel quit reeling. the bobber is too hard to get back in the shaft. whoever invented this should give money back. Please do not buy this for your kids.
__label__2 Braun: i liked the product . it did not hurt much.the only thing i didnt like personally is the noise when i switch on the machine. neverthless, it works just fine. i too read a number of reviews before i bought the product. as mentioned elsewhere, i think with frequent use, the pain subsides
__label__2 Saved his Best for Last: This album is a must for all Harrison fans, and deserves a listen even by those who are not. His talent and spirituality are up front in the music and lyrics, which are mostly explorations of Harrison's feelings about life and God, with a few surprises in the form of more whimsical offerings like "The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea", and the bluesy "Rocking Chair in Hawaii", which point to his versatility as an artist. The chant performed by Harrison and Dhani, his son, at the end of the title track is especially poignant. The album released posthumosly and finished by Jeff Lynne and Dhani is a testament to a musician and man who was much loved by his family, friends, and fans.
__label__1 Worst product I have ever purchased: I bought one of these a few months ago and it broke almost immediately. The metal prongs that attach the head to the handle popped out of the handle the very first time I used it.I couldn't believe that something would be so poorly made, so, embarrassingly, I purchased another one. The second one broke BEFORE I EVEN GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT. Again, the head popped off the handle.Unbelievably bad.
__label__1 Okay, but not scary: I thought from the reviews that this movie would be better than it was. It looks like a movie that was made for the Sci Fi Channel. It's okay if your flipping through channels for something to watch, but I wouldn't spend money on it. It's not scary or even tense. I think the person who wrote wow must have been in the movie or had a friend in it. I don't see anyway anyone could watch this movie and say wow. I try to see every horror film I can. I don't scare very easy, but I don't think even a child would be scared by this one.
__label__1 HP Premium Plus Photo Paper, High Gloss: Not at all satisfied with the photo paper backing. I glue my photos into our album and this absorbent backing makes this virtually impossible.
__label__2 So they sound like Relient K...They are still good!: I bought this for my niece who is a teenager. She loves it... says they are her favorite band. I confess... I listen to it as well and like it, too.
__label__2 Great, but where's the back pouch?: I really liked this stroller. We took it with us to Disney, and although it is big, it folds small enough to get on the trams. The stroller is a dream to push! I will never use another. My only complaints are:1) We shopped around and looked at some in other colors in our home town to test drive. The other Safari models had back pouches (which would have been super convenient). It was not clear that this model/color combination must be slightly different - no back pouch.2) The parent's drink caddy is worse than useless! the holders are shallow, and ours would not stay hooked onto the stroller causing the drinks to spill. We removed it and left it home the sencond day, and were much happier.Still it's a good model, good price, smooth ride, easy push with nice adjustable handles.
__label__1 Shorter than the description claims: I carefully measured my tripod and ball head before ordering this bag. They measured 31 long, so the bag was supposed to be 31 1/2 inches. Well the bag is a little short! Yeah I can get it in there but not like the fit should be. A real strain on the zipper and you cannot stand the bag up like you should be able to.
__label__1 Poor: This does not work one bit i would like a refund immeditately. It shows the front screen after that it freezes.
__label__1 Cute costume, poor customer service: I got this costume for my son's colonial day project. I ordered a large, but the company sent a medium costume in a package marked as large. Amazon customer service was very helpful in trying to help me resolve this issue, but ultimately could do nothing but refund my money since they did not actually fill the order. They gave me a phone number to the company the costume came from. I left several voicemails, but no one ever called me back, so I had to return the item. It was cute and would have looked good for the project, but the frustration of trying to get correct size that was ordered was not worth the hassle.
__label__2 GREAT toy: I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 6 months old. She absolutely loved it. In fact, I just started packing away many of her "baby" toys (she'll be 3 in 2 months) and this was the only one that she protested so I left it with her "big girl" toys. Every Leap Frog toy I've bought her has been wonderful. They're all so educational, attention-grabbing and durable.
__label__2 A Classic: This is Mannheim Steamroller's first--and best--Christmas album. If I had to pick an all-time favorite Christmas album, this would be it. My favorite cut is the rocked-out version of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen," which will compel the listener to jump to their feet and start dancing. That cut is followed by a haunting version of "Silent Night," which will bring back childhood memories of soft Christmas lights twinkling in a darkened living room...at least, it always does for me.
__label__2 Sweet recollection: I admit that I love memoirs. And memoirs are either emotionally haunting or literary bores. Yet Alison Smith's recollection of late childhood is somehow neither. Her focus is on the loss of her brother, a sibling so close in friendship that their mother often refers to them as one entity, Alroy (Alison and Roy).You would assume the death of a brother and best friend would be in the emotionally haunting grouping for the sad isolation of the protagonist. Or in the literary bore because, yes, many people have suffered a young death and written about it. Smith's memoir offers some sweet sadness with many more moments of laugh out loud hope.This is a perfectly written autobiography where the harshness of real life is outdone by Smith's determination for survival and acceptance. You'll stay up late just to read another chapter and, when you finish, you'll want to telephone Alison and see how an old friend is doing these days.
__label__2 Good enough: No problems with the function of the unit. I like the 3 settings (low, med, high) and the auto setting. However, the high setting is ridiculously loud and I often turn it off for that reason. It cracks me up to notice when the air quality gets worse according to the unit: when I open the window, when the dishwasher is running, when I vacuum, when something is cooking in the oven.Unfortunately, the uv bulb doesn't last very long (see my review on that product)and the replacement filters are half the price of the unit.Otherwise, I have noticed less allergy symptoms since I've purchased the unit and it removes smoke and other unpleasant smells quickly.
__label__2 Amazing: This cd is absolutly amazing and they are by far the best young band out there today. They are going to be absolutly huge once this gets out in the mainstream.
__label__2 Simply Divine: This book provides an excellent insight into a humble soul truly united with Christ. It's an inspiration to re-examine our own lives to see the how we can unite our sufferings with the Lord and allow Christ to work through us. It also reinforces the message of God's Divine Mercy and God's desire to shower us with His mercy when many may think we do not derserve it or even want it. While we can never merit God's mercy, He truly was working through St. Faustina to spread his message that he wants to give his Mercy to all who accept Him and to the whole world which is in so desperate need of Mercy. Reading this book will make you look at things differently and it is a grace to read.
__label__1 NOT HAPPY: Bought my first one several years ago and got to use it 4 times before it died. Auto Zone kindly allowed me to exchange it. The new one was used the day I got it and went to use it again about 2 months ago and got it out of its box and guess what, that's right. Not working. Pleased? I don't think so. It is the Schumacher model se-2151MA SPORTS POWER. Where's the power?
__label__2 Great Read!: Loved this book. First heard the song during a show with the Oak Ridge Boys preforming and learned of the book at the same time. My father is a WWII veteran. I so enjoyed the storyline.
__label__2 Something to be desired...: This book is pretty darn good. The original Mennyms was one heck of alot less bizzare. I mean, gohsts magic doors,... It leaves something to be desired I've got to admite. It is a good book but kinda leaves you hangin'. All I've got to say is, the writing style just don't work.
__label__2 The best iced tea maker I have ever used.: This Hamilton Beach iced tea maker makes AMAZING tea. It is so simple to use, and I highly recommend purchasing this over the Mr. Coffee models. (Which I have also used in the past). I use 2 family-size Luzianne tea bags and set the filter to strong, and the best iced tea I have ever brewed at home comes out of this maker. About the only small concern I have is the amount of ice cubes it requires. I literally use 3 ice cube trays to fill the ice capacity line in the pitcher, but in the long run it is worth it. Buy this iced tea maker--you won't be disappointed!
__label__2 Kept your interest: This book had a nice story line to it. It was a romance, but also had a bit more than just two people lusting for each other like a lot of other books. Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of that, but also a story to go along with it.
__label__2 maze: Grandson didn't open it on Christmas day as there were too many other things to play with but I think he will use it when his parents take him for car rides.
__label__2 I am wearing it out!: I love this new CD. I fear i will wear it out. The Chieftans have returned to their roots with such vigor. Lovers of traditional music, be it Irish or otherwise, will love this CD.
__label__1 Not as bad as the reviews: This is not that bad of a book. However, if you are using it as the sole preparation for the exam, you are in trouble. I haven't seen the Sybex book yet, but I would consider purchasing that one also.
__label__2 An excellent introduction CD to the great Charlie Parker!!: There are so many Charlie Parker CD's out there , it can be confusing. This one believe me, captures Parker in peak form. Recorded in 1949-50, this CD is more melodic and romantic than the bebop recordings he did with Dizzy Gillespie and others. The Song Is You, and I Remember You are worth the price of admission alone. A lot of bebop is nervous and edgy. Not this one. It is a beautiful CD and one of the finest examples of Parker's legendary talent. This one, Charlie Parker With Strings and Yardbird Suite are the three best Parker CD's to own, in my opinion. Parker makes it sound so easy and natural, but he was perhaps the most innovative and influential improvisor of all time. It was like he invented breathing and we now all take it for granted.
__label__2 What a learner of Homeric Greek needs: Owen and Goodspeed's "Homeric Vocabularies" is a short but useful book for anyone learning Ancient Greek by reading Homer. It is less useful for someone who already knows Ancient Greek well but wants to read Homer; for that person one of the available Homeric Lexicons would be more useful.The book is simple: three sections of about 600 words each, divided into verbs, nouns, and other. These are the words most used in Homer and thus worth learning before reading. There are many words not covered in this book, but since most of those are only used once or twice, it is hardly worthwhile to etch their meaning in your memory.Take note that only the basic form of each word is included, so you'll have to consult other sources if you want to know some unusual or irregular form. Learning the words in this book will make reading Homer easier and will keep you from needing to consult a lexicon on every line.
__label__2 Pretty darn cool!: My 3 year old is very, very smart. She was already counting, but thanks to Team Umizoomi she's counting to 40, recognizing patterns and shapes, and even making patterns of her own.I was dubious about Nick Jr shows because so many of them are just squeaky and irritating, but Team Umizoomi is awesome. The theme song and music within episodes is reminiscent of a They Might Be Giants album, and i really don't find it annoying at all.Also, the digital copy is clear and unblemished, in case you're concerned about that kind of thing. But since its streaming online, its portable and instantly available.
__label__2 FINALLY!!!!!!: I have waited MANY years for this to come out on DVD. My VHS tapes gave out long ago. I saw this originally on TV and remember vividily my mother trying to record the movies from the TV to a VHS tape but trying to edit the commercials and the "scenes I was too young to see". I love Patrick Swayze in this movie. The costumes, the settings, everthing almost made me wish I was born in this movie.
__label__2 Love: My daughter loves these! She would eat these all day if i would let her. I am happy that they give her so much protein as well.
__label__2 EDUCATIONAL: There is a lot of explanatory speech in CD. I was hoping to listen to bird sounds and relax when I ordered this. But all series of Birding by ear from PETERSON field guides are with speech. Actually it has the name guides, so I don't blame the product.If you need to analyze and study bird sounds all series of "Peterson" are ideal for you.If you want to relax listenning to the bird sounds, mixed with nature sounds like rivers, waves and rain, then you should check products from DON GIBSON (like bird morning songs or SACD-Surround Audio CD symphony).
__label__2 L still sounds sick!: I've been an LL Cool J fan for several years now. I was disappointed with most of "Phenomenon" and "The GOAT" was mostly forgetable, save a few sweet tracks. When I read that "10" was going to be free of profanity, LL piqued my interest. He'd been relying far too much on a vulgar and aimless sound for a long time, I thought that now he would be working on refining his creative wordplay--and I was right. "10" shows LL at his best when he is rapping slick love songs, social commentary or even his trademark tracks about how great he is. The production quality is great and the songs LL has created here prove that he's got the skills to call himself the Greatest of All Time. Long live LL!
__label__1 The Last Precinct: This particular book by Cornwell is not up to par.The storyline is too convoluted and the antagonist, Scarpetta, needs an anti-depresent. Ms. Cornwell obviously had to write a certain amount of words because much of what is written is unnecessary for the storyline.
__label__1 NOTHING TO DRINK IN GUATEMALA: Well, here we are in Guatemala, the most populated country in Central America, and we find the filter bag leaks like a sieve. Appears the thread design is faulty and the "O" ring is not thick enough to seal the connection and so we are without filtered water. POOR DESIGN. I have contacted KATADYN to see if they have an International solution for us! Be sure and check yours out before camping or traveling and be aware the problem worsens with each use.
__label__1 Would prefer the hard copy: I am very displeased espcially now that I have found out the Kindle version is only $2.31 cheaper than the hard copy. What a rip off! The pictures (figures)are also very hard to see on the Kindle screen. I am going to see if Amazon will let me erase the copy from my Kindle, the backup from Amazon and refund my money so I can buy the hard copy.
__label__2 Excellent Shave, especially for those with the "Fred Flintson" effect: I found this razor to be the best one I have ever used! Having sufferd from the "Fred Flintson Effect"(i.e. perminate 5'0clock shadow) all of my life, I have always found it hard to get a close shave, and would always end up with razor burn and having to shave twice a day. WIth this razor, and a little effort, I get a really close, smooth shave which last the day! The charge is quick and last a long time. It is easy to clean, so you constintly get a better shave. FOR THE PRICE and all around quality, you can't beat this razor!
__label__1 TERRIBLE: First, I wished I had checked the reviews before purchasing! I have owned other Bushnell Binoculars, but these are by far the worst I have used. I took an Alaska trip and nearly every time I used the binoculars it was necessary to re-focus both lenses. I would not recommend these at all, there are many better pairs of binoculars on the market for a comparable price.
__label__1 Don't Buy These: This product is terrible. I tried these pods repeatedly in my new espresso machine and ended up with something that looked like weak tea. Amazon was kind enough to refund my money when I complained.Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso, Single Dose Pods (Pack of 150)
__label__1 Hunting Evil: I would like to share with everyone my thoughts about this book. I think that Carlton Smith is a very lowsy writer. He never interviewed me or "Charloette". He never interviewed my mother or james either. I didn't even find out about this book until 3 months after it was published. I would like everyone to know that I feel that my rights were violated because in the 2nd paragraph on page 179, my real name was printed. Being that I am a minor at the age of 16, I do believe that is against the law.As far as accuracy, it was very accurate (the events where i was victimized) I also don't understand why this book was written before the trial. I am the daughter of Michelle Michaud and I know how "Evil" she really is. She goes beond the meaning of that word.
__label__2 cute little camera: cute little camera! i got it as a gift for a friend and she flipped. it came within the time quoted. so far, so good!!!
__label__1 Don't waste your money: I have watched a lot of anime in my day and this is easily the worst I've ever seen. Bad animation, terrible story writing, bad voice-acting, no depth, no character development. Please trust me on this one and don't bother watching it. This is on par with the legend of zelda animated series, which was pretty terrible.
__label__1 Not for a Student Potter: To look at the picture on the DVD you would think this was an instructional DVD. Not so. It is a preacher telling us how God made us from clay and I believe that He did just that. I go to Church and I am a religious person and I appreciate the message. However, I think to make people think this is an instructional video was and is wrong. It should state that it is a sermon. I have no problem with the sermon and I will watch it eventually but right now I am interested in learning different pottery techniques. From now on I will read everything I can about what I am purchasing.
__label__1 Beware of the Shape Sorter on the Door: My daughter recieved the laugh and learn learning home for her first birthday. She has been using it for a little over a month, and it keeps her entertained. BEWARE OF THE SHAPE SORTER ON THE DOOR! My daughter was placing the shapes through the "shape sorter" on the door, and while trying to get the shapes back out, her arm got stuck in the star shape! She frantically tried to get her arm out, which only made things worse. We ended up getting her arm out, and I am really surprised it didn't fracture her wrist. Before this incident, I would have recommended this product without reservation, unfortunately now, I tell people to steer clear.
__label__2 Love this strap!: I play in a band that has been together for about two years now and we've played shows all over Florida and therefore our gear takes quite a punishment. I used to use common straps that slipped over the knobs on the guitar but when the strap kept coming off during shows when i would move around I looked into a locking strap. I came across this strap and decided to buy it. I've had the same strap for almost a year now and it has never come off during a show, even when I throw the guitar around a bit. This strap is great for the casual guitarist and touring band member alike. I would highly recommend this strap to anyone who is looking for a dependable strap that has the durability and strength to hold up to touring or just everyday use.
__label__2 Great Stuff: A very cool mix of music. This CD always makes it into my daily rotation because there's a wide variety. It's as if Jack Johnson got mixed with Big Head Todd, but with far superior lyrics.Waiting for CD #2, but for now, it's kinda cool to be the "first kid on the block" with a new artist.
__label__1 You get what you pay for.: The quality control sucks. Several bits had the holes in the center off center. The case did not close well and some bits rattled around. I spent almost 3 times as much for my set but it worked the first time and will work many more. I do my own lock work and I use security/tamper-proof screws so these bits have to work. Save up and pay a little more.
__label__1 This is worse than buying printer cartridges: Just like for printers, you pay an equivalent amount or more for "refills". I ended up just buying a box of cake mix for 2 bucks and a can of frosting. Works just as well, costs much less, and you can get a couple dozen cakes out of it!
__label__2 nice book for some serious & useful reading: a great book for those interested in objectivism, which sets forth the fundamentals of Rand's philosophy. it is a challenging new look at modern society by one of the most of provocative individuals in american scene. an amazing book to read
__label__2 Great polish/conditioner: This review is for the Acquarella Conditioner - I LOVE it! Following their directions to apply, it stays on and on and on... I use the conditioner for my "polish" on my fingernails as I don't like colored nails. Using their entire system from buffing to polishing, my nails look healthy and great! There is no odor, it is easy to apply, and it is strong, unlike other hypo-allergenic polishes I have used in the past. I am allergic to most nail polishes, NO reaction to this one.
__label__2 Awesome Socal Relic: I came about finding this gem while looking for a studio version of Social D's "Lude Boy." Well i found the Social D song and also discovered a bunch of lesser known bands that were not too shabby either. I was already a fan of Christian Death and 45 Grave(loved the version of "Evil" on here), but I had never heard of groups like Legal Weapon, Secret Hate, or Modern Warfare. I can listen to this cd all the way through without skipping any songs. Sunny Socal punk definatley had a dark side in the early 80's that was often both campy and creepy at the same time. The sound quality is suprisingly very good and all the tracks have a srong kick to them. Highly recommended!
__label__2 Does the job.: Works just like you'd expect. I use this in my laundry room on a regular basis. It's nice and sturdy.
__label__1 What A Deal,NOT!!!!!!!!: Whats going on with Season 2 Big Valley? 40 bucks retail for half a season,20th Century Fox-Your F-Fing nutts.I was so excited with season 1, i ran out that day it came out and bought it.

__label__2 Among the Great Books of Importance for Society: This book should be read by anyone who wants to be, or thinks they are, a member of a "non-discriminating" society. I first read this book seven years ago, and it changed my life forever-- and having been raised by a scientist, in addition to being stubborn to a fault, I do not concede to any argument unless it is razor-sharp and extremely thorough. Singer's are sharp, and will cut your heart out. Basing his arguments on scientific observation, the philosophy of ethics, and stern logic, this book seamlessly challenges the mainstream beliefs of our society. Warning: Don't read this book if you are a conformist or are afraid of change. However, if you EVER in your life plan to participate an argument for or against the case for animal rights or vegetarianism I would highly suggest you read this book first. Otherwise you will merely be uninformed and therefore annoying. Nuff said. READ THE BOOK.
__label__1 garbage: ...Let me keep this as simple as possible: the music on this album is bad. Really bad. And if the you're not repulsed enough by their childish noise, maybe Tom Yorke's generic leftist, paranoid lyrics can push you over the edge. Wow, an "artist" has something negative to say about the US government and those running the show - I'm shocked. I'm sick of baseless ranting like this. It's like Paul Simon said, "a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest..."Avoid this album, and give up on Radiohead ever releasing another ground-breaking LP ever again - it aint gonna hapen.
__label__2 Never lost in Bangkok: The book was a little helpful, but the map was great. My husband and I had a great time and never got lost. The best part is the Chatechuk Weekend Market map inset. It was very helpful!!
__label__2 Pleasantly suprised: I am not a vampire fan, at least I wasn't until I read this book. I gave it a try simply because of all the hype it received, the same reason I chose not to read the Harry Potter books.Anyway, I found myself really enjoying this book. I read the book in less than a week and am looking forward to reading New Moon.My only complaint about this book is one I have seen many times: how many times can the author talk about Edward's eyes? Meh, it kind of made the book move slowly here and there.Overall a good read :)
__label__2 Easy to use - Great Design: I love this diaper disposal system! Large opening in the top makes it easy to get soiled diapers in. Triple seal system keeps odors to a minimum - we change our bag/liner once a week. As far as refills go - the one that came with it is still in there and our daugheter is 5 weeks old now. Very impressed with how long the refill liners last. Easy to remove the bag for disposal and easy to pull the new one down into place. Plus, this can convert to a trash can after the diaper phase is over with!
__label__2 BTNH: As a member of BTNH, Bizzy has put together another album of Pure Harmony. "The Gift" is a remarkable piece of Music that goes to show that you don't always need to Rap, Sing or Commit violence to get your message across to the youth of todays world. Bizzy and BTNH has always promoted God into there life and through there music has slowly been changing the world of Hip Hop Thugster Music from what we've always know and was used to. I am huge fan of BTNH for all they represent, but even if your not as much of a fan as I am, you will surely enjoy "The Gift" by Bizzy Bone.
__label__2 Lasted Nearly 5 Years: No problems with this ever. The intake fan started to rattle after nearly 5 years, so I retired it in honor. GREAT power supply.
__label__2 Two Unlikely Friends: When I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain in high school, it was possibly the first book I enjoyed that was assigned by a teacher. Twain's imagery puts the reader right beside Huck while he escapes &#65533;sivilization&#65533; and floats down the Mississippi river with his slave-gone-fugitive friend Jim. Huck&#65533;s innocent outlook on the world is both humorous and adorable. Huck&#65533;s respect for Jim is admirable. Even though Huck was brought up with Jim being a inferior slave, he still looks up to Jim. Also, I think that although Jim&#65533;s dialect adds to the effectiveness of the book, it is very difficult to understand. I think Twain writes it a little too much how the dialect sounds. I would recommend this book to anyone. It offers plenty of excitement and surprises.
__label__2 Helpful Guide to a 5: I found this book very helpful for two reasons: the practice tests, and the terminology. If you know the terminology thoroughly, it will undoubtedly boost your score. The writing samples are decent, although its quite hard to capture that in a book. The practice tests are excellent, and as is implied by their name, the best way to prepare for the test. I reviewed with this book the week before the test and got a 5. I would recommend it as the best guide for this test.
__label__2 Delicious and arrived quickly: I've haven't been using it for very long, so I can't say much about results. But this stuff is absolutely delicious. My friend has it in chocolate and he's gotten pretty big. So I decided to buy it. I recommend it to anyone.
__label__1 Only good for heating water: This product warped right away, although it straightened out somewhat in the dishwasher. The microwave fan kept knocking it off the cup or bowl and if anything in the bowl exploded (like carrots do in soup) it knocked it off too.
__label__2 Excellent academic work: This work is an excellent study of the first African-American governor in the United States. Professor Jeffries does a competent job of explaining the pieces of the puzzle that needed to fall into place in order for Douglas Wilder to be elected governor of Virginia. He then goes on to discuss the policies of the Wilder administration. This discussion is very thorough and well-researched. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the field of political science.
__label__2 Taunting "Haunted": Chuck Palahniuk's got an incredibly creative mind. That's why I love reading his work. He comes up with stories that titilate the mind while churning the stomach. Unfortunately, this latest "novel" should have remained just a collection of intriguing -- yet disturbing -- short stories.In "Haunted," Palahniuk tries to weave them all together by creating a storyline between each short story that features the characters in each of the short stories. Unfortunately, it's this ongoing storyline that is the weakest part of the book, as it lost this reader's interest. In addition to this ongoing storyline, there are poems about each of the characters that I could have done without before each of the short stories.While the ongoing storyline of characters "trapped" inside a house had a couple of interesting moments, it's the short stories that truly make this book worth having in your collection.
__label__1 A $110.00 SHOVEL!: It is a SHOVEL. A $110.00 SHOVEL! Are they out of their minds? IT IS A SHOVEL for $110.00!
__label__2 Very impressed: Within two days of ordering, it arrived. I was impressed by this but even more impressed when I used it to crush some food for my tropical fish. I need to crush some shrimp and other fish foods for my baby fish. It worked perfectly. I can adjust how fine I wish to crush the foods. It is big enough that you can get a good grip on it and the threads work quickly when opening and closing. I highly recommend this to anyone that needs to crush something.
__label__2 Yo Gagga Gagga! Music Makes Me Move: It entertains our 2 years old. He enjoys this video and it keeps him busy. That's a good thing!! He likes it, so I do too.
__label__2 Good if not the greatest: Lushly produced and surprisingly coherent following the madness of the early "Rock N'Roll" sessions, this album finds Lennon somewhat lonely but still capable of cranking out popular pop like "Whatever Gets You Thru The Night." "Scared" and "Nobody Loves You" are superb descriptions of hitting bottom. Unfortunately, there aren't too many great melodies here, and "Old Dirt Road" sounds like "Imagine", while "Steel and Glass" sounds like "How Do You Sleep."
__label__2 Good fit, comfy: These are a good fit and very comfortable. Make sure you check your shoe size with the s,m,l range carefully.
__label__2 Kindle2 rocks: I love my Kindle 2! Boy is it an attention getter at the gym--easy to read and very convenient to use.
__label__2 Just what I ordered: The product I ordered came in a timely manner and was exactly what I was looking for.
__label__2 Came quickly and is perfect for what my son is using it for: This item was packed very carefully and all the drawers where there. My son uses it for his legos and is just perfect for that. Price was good and reasonable and very happy with it.
__label__2 Love these pots!: I've had alot of different sets of pots over the years and I just love these! Love the fact that they're nonstick and dishwasher safe. They com out looking spotless. Would definately recomend!
__label__2 I like this product: My daughter is 6 months and she loves this toy. In the beginning I had to place a pillow under her feet so she could move around but now she is tall enough to reach. No paint chipping yet, she plays rough and it still stands. All I say is research the kind you want because you could wish it had more features. Wish it was 3 in 1; 1 sit in play, 2 sit and walk, 3 stand and push.
__label__2 Bells of St. Marys: A touching movie about a simpler time and thoughts that a prayer will come true. It shows also that if you take the time to understand people you can figure out what their needs really are.
__label__1 For ages 3 and up: Reading this was like playing Monopoly - with yourself! And with only the estates between Go! and Jail. It's short, unfulfilling and boring.The characters are cardboard stereotypes and the action is boring. If they wanted a science fiction writer, why couldn't they get a real one like Timothy Zahn?
__label__2 What?: Can one say about a line cord. If they work they work. If they do not work, they do not work and you get a replacement.
__label__1 Don't get too excited.: This game is not what I expected: here are my results:Graphics-1The backgrounds were horrible, the characters were small, and sometimes the screen gets fuzzy(not the tv's problem).Sounds(Backgroud music)-1The voices do not macth the charcters and the music was HORRIBLE!Gameplay-1The characters were slow and puny. the fireballs that came out of their hands were their specials. the code they give you to unlock the characters DOES NOT WORK!Overall- I am very disappointed with this game. Worst DBZ game EVER. DO NOT BUY!!! Wait for DBZ Budokai 2 coming in December 2003.
__label__2 Finally, a book about the *context* of the Web!: Today's publishers are busy churning out books about how to use this or that technology to build a web site. Almost all of these books are obsolete by the time they are published, and none provide the context with which to figure out what technologies are worth using in the first place.This book is different. It is not going to teach you how to XML-enabled your web site in 21 seconds. What it will do is give you a context for designing your site and plenty of battle-hardened advice on what technologies make sense and why.As an author, Mr. Greenspun has the advantage of not only being engaging, but thoughtful at the same time. As soon as I got this book in the mail I found I couldn't put it down and spent the next 5 hours glued to the pages before I fell asleep, exhausted. When was the last time you encountered a technical book *that* engaging?
__label__2 my mans packin: "repulse the monkey - part the wild horses mane" "im doggin it, lets go T" "i see a future chairman of a fortune 500 company, there i see a future rap artist..." "i like comedians, maybe i should book you on a tour sometime" "get off the scale!" "you're a negativity spreader" "there are alot of myths about the abdominal muscles, this is one i am glad to put to rest... you disgust me!"
__label__2 Easy, Fun Read: A great book to pick up, read a page or two and put back. Great for the coffee table too.
__label__1 watch out for target seller: received item but only 10 count box and not the 60 count box listed. not sure if just an isolated case, but i don't like that instead of making up the difference i now have to return the item and reorder. hassle! :(
__label__1 Some things are better off being bought in person: This mat smells like burnt plastic. When I first got it, I thought the smell would go away. I left it outside in the freezing cold air for two weeks. I brought it back to my room and my entire room started to be filled with the same smell again... I tried wiping it down with a wet cloth and windex but the smell still prevails. Just buy one from a nearby store or something. They're not hard to find.
__label__2 Needed Loud Horn for my ATV: I wanted to make my ATV "street legal" in Utah. Which means it needed turn signals, license plate light, and a horn - none of which my atv came with from the factory. My friends bought a "street legal" kit for nearly $200 for their atv. The horn that came with their kit is not loud or commanding sounding. I wanted something more. So I bought this horn. I just installed it and it is loud. I can hear it down the block from my house with my atv running. It seems well enough built, but time will tell. If it lasts a couple of years, it will be worth the $10.00 I paid for it.
__label__2 A Great Resource Book: This is the first curriculum book I ever bought. It was money well spent. It is a valuable resource when planning theme related activities. The activities are seperated into age categories. This is an extensive book. It is a resource book that both parents and teachers can use from late infancy to early school age.
__label__2 THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE FOR HOLOCAUST RESEARCH!: DO NOT attempt to navigate the labyrinthine National Archives without this guide as your compass!This is THE essential "Bible" for anyone interested in researching or learning more about Holocaust-era assets. An National Archives' insider with decades of experience, Dr. Bradsher has written the essential "Guide to the Perplexed" for researchers. In this work, he leads you through the millions of pages of Holocaust-related documents, explaining the records' organization, history, and content.Dr. Bradsher has produced the most important book ever published about U.S. archival records detailing Holocaust art, insurance, forced and slave labor, banking, Project Safehaven, and World War II economic warfare.In compiling this information, Dr. Bradsher has performed a vital public service. All Holocaust researchers, scholars, historians, and attorneys will be indebted to him when they read this important work.
__label__1 First Person Narrative: I had a really hard time getting into this book. It is partial due to the fact that I really dislike first person narrative; I have only read a small handful of books where the writer was able to pull of the first person narrative.The main character is not, imo, at all sympathetic. She is sometimes quite off-putting. I also find that the author just drones on and on with completely unrelated and not at all essential to the story line topics. I found that I just skipped half the book and not really missing any plot, just so I could get to the end and find out what happened.I only fished this book, because I hate leaving books unfinished.
__label__2 Ordered for gift: I don't yet know what my daughters will say about these books. I ordered one for each for Christmas gifts, so will have to see what they say about them. It looked great to me.
__label__1 mattress cover: Purchased a Mattress quilted Cover which was rip on the left side on arrival, I did not now how to return the item b/c I got rid of the box with the instruction, this is the first item that I purchase that I'm not 100% satisfied;
__label__1 Poor service company: The products don't come with a "snack over lid" or the lid. As a result of that, I had to use plastic wraps to cover the snack trap to prevent dirt/dust from going into the snack trap. I finally attempted to order the lids online and had trouble doing so because they have a very bad website. Well, I wrote and called and got no response from the company. What is the point of getting the snack trap if it doesn't come with lids? The product is poorly designed. I wish I didn't spend my money on it. What a waste!
__label__1 Where's Dirty Diana?: HIStory would have been a necessary purchase if Micahael Jackson would have decided to with hold all of the new material, and just released the greatest hits. He also should have put Dirty Diana and Smooth Criminal on this cd. Dirty Diana was a #1 hit!! Michael could have put one or two new songs on this cd, Scream is good, You are not alone is decent, but the second disc is torture to listen to the whole way through. Buy Bad and Thriller.
__label__2 Good Product: Bought it for my Dad. He loves it. Easy to read. It is pretty bright in a red LED way so not good for bedroom however makes a decent night light for navigating a room in the dark. Easy to read from far distances day or night from all angles.
__label__1 Subhuman.: "Beep Beep Who Got Da Keys To DA Jeep?" If that's what passes for good poetry these days, standards have decreased. Missy Elliot has the brains of an Anthropoid. By the way: I hate "beats."
__label__2 Great cargo bar: This is a must have for pickup truck owners. The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place. The ratchet part is very well made. You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving. Have had no problems at all.....
__label__1 My first Stephanie Plum -- Maybe that's the mistake: This was my first Stephanie Plum, or Janet Evanovich, for that matter. Got it in the RV park library. I was just looking for something fun. Well, it wasn't much. Maybe I'm too old or maybe I like GOOD literature too much to be taken in. Great writing it isn't! I kept thinking perhaps "Janet Evanovich" was a pen name for some adolescent boy in my former middle school English class. The ending took the cake. It was about as good as "it was all a dream." I did read to the end though -- therefore the 2 stars.
__label__2 Story of Saab as told by a European.: The author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows. In his history of this classic car, told from a British perspective, the text is easy to read, and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work. There are plenty of excellent photos, some in color but mostly not. I learned *why* the ignition key is on the floor (safety feature), and got further insights into this small company's heritage as an innovator, e.g. how, with the 96, they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the Citroen DS, or how they insisted, for safety reasons, on using heavier sheet metal than other makers, explaining its enduring status among automotive brands.
__label__2 An in-depth archaeological study of medieval footwear: Shoes And Patterns is an in-depth archaeological study of medieval footwear, made possible by preserved footwear of the 12th through 15th century discovered along the north bank of the river Thames and permanently housed in the collection of the Museum of London. The detailed and informative text is enhanced throughout this impressive work of archaeological and historical scholarship with numerous black-and-white photographs and drawings which make the shoes of centuries ago as real and practical as if they were worn today. An essential addition to academic Medieval History studies reference collections, Shoes And Patterns is particularly recommended reading for theatrical costumers, replica-makers, historical reenactors and anyone with a festive curiosity about this down-to-earth topic of medieval footwear.
__label__1 How boring: 'Nuff said. Dense, uninteresting, and a work of complete vanity. I wish I could get away with writing a few hundred pages of blither at the end of a road trip probably on someone else's dime.Paging through a road atlas is much more exciting.
__label__2 Liberals Read This Book!: A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York, United StatesTo say that this is an informative easy read is to grossly understate thefacts. I have been a lifelong democrat...ok a liberal democrat. I alwaysjust assume that all of these guys are just Rush Limbaugh clones, allsinging from his hymnal. A friend of mine convinced me to read this book andI must admit...I have started to re-think some of my views. This guy stateshis opinion & gives you the FACTS to back it up...it's hard to dispute whathe says. I'm still a democrat (notice I left the "d" lower case), but nolonger consider myself a liberal...I can't believe it myself...READ THISBOOK!
__label__1 Probably not what you're expecting...: If you're expecting a nice, concise introduction to the Spartans, you will be very disappointed with this book. As most reviewers have stated below, Cartledge is clearly an authority on the subject...it's his writing style that is at issue.It's a bad sign when a history nut (me), with a particular affinity for Mediterranean culture, is unable/unwilling to finish a book of this brevity. Maddeningly confusing, and, in my opinion, totally unreadable.
__label__2 It seemed like a pretty good movie!: It seemed like a pretty good movie, but watching it on my desktop wasn't very pleasurable. I missed some audio and my screen is too small. I think WIFI to a large flatscreen is the only way to watch these movies.
__label__2 Brilliant - I laughed soooo hard: More style than Soul Train, full of great one-liners to wow your fiends with. This film will "give you an education" in 70's california action. The clothes, cars, and hair do's are wonderful and highly entertaining! Jim Kelly is smooth and slick - he puts James Bond to shame.
__label__1 Wishful Militarism: I have read all of the Patrick Robinson books and have enjoyed them even though Robinson verges on the edge of serious right wing political militarism. This last book is not only on the verge as his other books have been, this one falls off the edge into significant political right-wing claptrap. This author is too good to let himself drift into the blind espousal of such ideology. Thus I was disappointed in this book. The story is fun; it kept me interested; it stretched credibility a little too often. But those lapses are hallmarks of such books. What pushed me over the edge were the constant references to pro/redneck/republican/Limbaugh generalities. The Oliver North-like colonel was too much. I will read one more of Robinson's; hopefully he can rise above this god-awful ideology.
__label__1 Book binding: I am aware of the methods for correctly handling books; yet, the back on this one broke the first time I opened it. The binding is substandard; the book is great!
__label__2 Detail is the stuff of magic: This book is very well researched and organized. I enjoyed looking through it and reading about the historical origins of witchcraft and pagan practices. I found this book to be exceptional! I highly recommend it for anyone interested in witchcraft for the purposes of practice or just general curiosity about religious beliefs and how they came to be.
__label__2 Required Reference: I spent the weekend with this book and find it as first skimming suggests- a reference of the highest order, packed from front to back with solid information for the video industry. It is unique among all similar books I've seen in that it is completely comprehensive. I'm buying more copies for my staff, and have recommended it to engineers at other PBS stations.
__label__1 We need a hip hop garbage man to take this hot garbage out!: Khia is one of the worst female MC's (most confused) ever! She raps about trash and looks like trash too. Gangstress?!?!?!?! Why don't you try being a woman, mother, and a respectable person first! The lyrics on this album are poor. The beats are corny and the whole concept behind this album is commercial and lame just like the first one. Make sure to get a gander of all the hoodrat pictures on the cover!!!! LOL!!
__label__1 Not worth it: The song selections on this dvd do not represent the tv series. I had hoped that the music by various artists would be the best of La Femme Nikita. Instead I found the songs were not up to the show's episodes.
__label__2 Kids love animal noises: My daughter was given this toy when she was 9 months old. The magnets make it east to put the animals in the barn. At nine months, she could not match the animals, but she could put the pieces in. When a match is correct the toy sings "you made a match!" then makes the animal sound. If it the pieces do not match it names your animal- "a horse-duck, that's silly" It is very cute. Kids are rewarded with song whether they are old enough to match or not. Now, at twelve months, it is more age appropriate for my daughter. She still loves it, it never got boring like so many other toys.
__label__1 Very disappointing: The title of this book is misleading. Only one chapter in the entire book deals with hedged scale trading and to sum it up the author says..."buy puts". Brilliant. The rest of the book describes scale trading (poorly) and fundamental analysis. If you want to learn about scale trading go to the source. Look at Robert Weist's, "You Can't Loose Trading Commodities". Weist does a much better job describing this trading technique. This book was a real disappointment and waste of money (in my opinion).
__label__1 ah come on mr. director..: i love donnie yen on iron monkey and once upon a time in china 2, so i decided to buy this movie expecting a raw good kung fu action. However, I ended having a a huge dissapointment on the film because the action are being fast forward in purpose so that it will look like they are fighting rapidly. I would have continue watching the film if the director would just left the action scene the way it was without fast forwarding it. The action lost its rawness; therefore, about 20 minutes later of the film i stop watching it. This film is about the fourth time in a row that I wasted my money with kung fu movies such as the last duel, deadful melody and the leg fighters. I need to be more cautios next time =(
__label__1 Not a practical book. Making more money selling the book.: I believe he is making more money selling the book than doing what he explain on the book.Vague Ideas, "look neat ideas" in paper but not that good on practice.It contradict itself in one part. It said in the middle of the book if you have few eggs to be brave and put it all in one basquet instead of few eggs on different basquets.At the end of the book he said that you have to keep your eggs on different baskets.I fo not think all the realism that is on the book. I read he has 4 employments. The last one was in Xerox company. From there he build up a his empire and while he was still working at Xerox he bought a Porche.I heard his cashflow books and he said he was dead broke for many years. Where fit this time frame on the first book?I think he made or exagerate some of his stories and the best income are from the Intellectual property of the books.As he said it in the book. "Its not well written, but it sells by the tittle he put in it"
__label__1 "Muzak" like.: The reviews on this CD so far have been excellent: five stars (from both US & UK sites). Technically, the Caravelles sung very well: clear diction, in pitch, good ensemble, voices harmonized with each other, and with decent arrangements/accompaniments. But why does it only received two stars from me?The answer is rather simple: you get tired of the lack of inflection in the Caravelles' raspy-voices, as well as the same-tempo-in-every-song, very very fast. Some people might treasure the nostalgic value of this group, I found it rather excruciating listening to the CD from beginning to the end. I do like Easy-Listening music (Nelson Riddle, Mantovani, Peter Nero, Rogers Williams...), but not the kind that sounds so plain and resembles "Muzak".
__label__2 Good gps for good price: This is my first gps. I got it for a very good price. It's works really well and gives good directions. Only problem I have is that it's not current. It doesn't show directions to areas that are more than a year old.
__label__2 top notch: If you're interested in religion, buy a bible. If you're interested in making your property water secure, buy this book. It's a ripper.
__label__2 Not Action Packed But Rowling Fills in Holes...: The fifth book in the Harry Potter series is no where near as action packed or mystery filled as the previous installments have been, nevertheless, it does to a very good job of making sure the reader knows exactly what's going on. The book has no solid, outlineable plot, but rather is more concerned with filling you in on what exactly has been happening with the characters since the story left off. Though the book is mostly information, Rowling of course could not leave us without her characteristic showdown at the end, which results in the tragicly foretold death everyone has been talking about. Though it might be disappointing to some Potter fans who expected some epic battle of good and evil, the book is very well written and fabulous overall. Not to mention the fact that it gives you information that will undoubtedly be crucial in future installments and leads nicely into book six. Well done...
__label__2 Great Camera for the Beginner: Not a camera buff? This is an easy to setup and use camera. Great for ordinary snapshots at family gatherings etc. No need to spend big bucks on more expensive "mega zoom" cameras unless you are a pro and wish to take a picture of a bear a mile away. For most people, this camera fits the bill nicely.I wish it had come with the SD memory disk though, that would have been a lot easier than taking the camera to a store to see which one fit.Interesting to note, it cost less from Amazon than it did from the manufacturer.I recommend this camera to anyone who has ordinary photo needs and limited photography knowledge/skill.
__label__2 A fine swansong...: I had previously rated this CD as two stars,and said that it wasn't very good- I would give it 4 stars now. My apologies to the members of Toto- after time to listen to the CD more, it is a fine effort.Toto has since announced that they will no longer be together in a permanent manner- too bad, because the world needs bands like Toto; great songwriting and musicianship. To me, bands like Toto, Journey, Foreigner, Boston, etc. defined my adolescent years. I still prefer to listen to these, my favorite bands after all of these years. Enough rambling..."Falling in Between" took a while to grow on me, but it is a fine album- absolutely worth getting if you are a even a casual fan of Toto. It is a very diverse CD, with everything that you would expect of Toto: ballads, rockers, and everything in between.
__label__2 sony headphones: I had a pair of these before and I need a replacement because I lost my last pair. I love them
__label__2 WOW!: Wow! Ace of Base is finally back! I wasnt too impressed with Cruel Summer (US version of Flowers)- i liked it , but not as much as THE BRIDGE. I imported this cd, and i was like WHOA! They took what make thier first album great, updated it, added some depth, funky beats, and great vocals! Tracks to check out are: Da Capo, Hey Darlin, Change with the Light, Unspeakable, and The Junvenile (my favorites, but they're all really awsome). DEFINATELY worth buying! The only downside is that there is a CD-Protection method used, which wont let it play it CD-ROMS of computers. Also availible is the DaCapo DVD - that's next on my "To-Import" list. Great job AOB! This is by far the best AOB cd yet! too bad only 12 tracks.
__label__1 Not sure who the intended audience is: I have an extensive math background and found this book tough to read. Not because the math described is particularly complicated (it is most definitely not...high school algebra is sufficient), but because Ross' writing style is too verbose. 99% of readers should know the meaning of "average," yet Ross devotes a lot of text to explaining this concept. I'm not sure who his audience is. Math-savvy people may feel that concepts have been dumbed-down and over explained, but math-phobic people may be scared off by the use of formulas...and the majority of times they aren't really needed anway.
__label__2 organic cotton socks: Excellent quality, medium weight, not too heavy, will not make shoes too tight. The color was NOT denim blue as requested though. It was aqua, and this was highly disappointing, as I wanted to wear with blue jeans.
__label__2 too small: This magnet, though very strong, is too small to cover much ground. I wanted to use it where old lumber with nails had been burned in a pretty large pile. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions given for the product than I did to the pictures. It is difficult to remove small pieces of steel from the magnet because of how strong it is. I should have bought a larger magnet than this one. I feel sure that this magnet would work fine for uses other than mine.
__label__2 Hotamale!!!!!!: I finally got a chance to read this book (after it passed through several hands at work). It was worth the wait and was everything everyone said it would be. It's just like J.J. from Good Times says, "it's DY-NO-MITE! Readers, you need to read this novel. It's a pageturner that is entertaining and educational. I loved it!
__label__1 Returning 2nd Copy. Tamron's Fault: I'm returning my second copy of this lens due to severe front focusing issues. I've done some research and found that Amazon was given a bad lot. This time I'm getting a refund, and possibly giving it a third try from another retailer. Sorry Amazon. You've been great in letting me return and even admitted that there is a quality control issue with the lot that you have received from Tamron. TAMRON.. shame on you. You should pull all of the copies that Amazon has and reissue them a new set.Everyone really loves this lens when it works. Wish I knew.
__label__1 Don't bother: This is a 1981 recording. Goode's 1997 recording of K. 488 (Nonesuch 79489) is much better and there are many good recordings of K 453 by other artists available that are significantly better. So . . . don't bother listening to this one.
__label__1 Rent it first: I love Kate Clinton. I think she is fabulous. However, this particular dvd left me a bit flat. Parts of it were entertaining enough but overall I don't think it's worth the money. I would suggest renting it first and if you like it enough then buy it. Having said that, Kate is still one of my favorite comedians.
__label__2 funny, funny man...: I have seen this man twice in person, and will see him again next time he is in town. Fluffy is so funny...Everyone that has seen this DVD that I know thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it if you want to entertain visitors to your home, or just want to laugh out loud!!!
__label__1 Very loud: To it's credit, this dryer is lightweight. The description of this item states it is "super quiet;" however, I found it to be quite loud on the high setting. Also, the diffuser attachment hurts my head. Someone needs to tell the folks at Revlon that the human head is spherical--not flat. Finally, the cold shot button takes several seconds before the air temperature drops; it's far quicker and simpler to just turn the dryer away from your hair to set the style. I am not able to see any increase in shine, luster, or smoothness from an ordinary hairdryer without Tourmaline or Ionic technology.
__label__2 My favorite pen: This is my favorite disposable pen. I've had my last two secretaries orders these specifically for me after our practice stopped purchasing them. The ink flow is smooth and consistent and doesn't require as much effort as other pens I've tried. This makes a difference when I'm filling up 10-30 pages with notes at a time in that my hand isn't as fatigued. I use the black mostly. The blue ink doesn't seem to flow quite as well but I don't use it that often. The pen lasts until the ink / gel interface reaches the point. I've not had any of the clips break off like on some cheaper pens. They are worth the extra cost.
__label__2 Wonderful!!: I brought this cd mainly for the Alanis song but I was surprised to discover the rest of the soundtrack was also great!! Even the instrumentals were soothing and the classic rock songs are awesome!!
__label__2 Lose weight and entertain well!: "Secrets of the French Diet" allows me to lose weight and entertain in a style that disguises my need to be calorie conscious. My friends have have marveled at my dishes and have expressed concern about all the weight they may be gaining as a result of eating my food.The recipes and directions are easy to follow and most items are at hand in a well-stocked pantry. The recipes allow for experimentation with dinner parties and simple and quick home meals.The travel area of this book allows memories of past travel and future places to visit with no airfare nor culinary surprises.My suggestion would be more pictures of finished dishes to allow for presentation ideas and platters or serving dishes. With pictures of the finished product you know even you can cook as the French do.
__label__1 freys: The towels were given as a Christmas gift. I really liked them until I washed them. There was a bunch of lint in the washer and when I took them out of the dryer toe towels had strings hanging from the edges. I was really disappointed. It was that way on two of the four sets. I sent them back
__label__1 Not for fleas!!: I had a light infestation of fleas after a dear pet died and bought this product to kill them before it got to be a major problem. I think the fleas did the backstroke then gave me the finger...it did not work. Needless to say, my light infestation got to be a big problem that I have not yet conquered.For the record, I only sprayed the concrete floor of my garage. I did this on 3 different days and the problem only got worse. I probably would have been better off mopping with hot soapy water. I don't think fleas can do the backstroke in soapy water.I can't say if it prevented anything else because I didn't have a problem with any other bugs.It got two stars because I liked the sprayer part.
__label__1 Warning - Do Not Buy - Warning: We used this software for several years and recently had to upgrade to the new version 4.0 because the older version 3.0 would not install on new Windows 7 systems. The new version cannot open any label files we created from the old version. So we have to start over. We called Nova Development's Tech Support and they basically told us that the company doesn't care about upgrading existing customers and that new versions would typically not read the files from old versions. If you have a business and plan to print the same labels for some time, look for other solutions and stay away from this software.
__label__2 Enjoy: This cd was everything I thought it would be. Of course, there are selections that I enjoy more than others. The seller was great in getting my cd to me.
__label__1 The Feature Presentation on the DVD will not play.: Only the previews of other movies play on the DVD Boy in the stripped pajamas will play. The feature presentation itself will not play. I contacted the sellers and was told to clean it with alcohol and it still does not work. The is no movie on the DVD.Yvonne Casen
__label__2 Publishers Weekly, objective review?: I have not read this book yet, but I have read some of Professor Johnson's other books (Darwin on Trial, Reason in the Balance, and The Wedge of Truth) in addition to many of his essays available online, and based on my familiarity with his writings I predict that the Publishers Weekly reviewer has not accurately represented this book. From the reviewers tone, I surmise that s/he is a Darwinian and that this book presents a major challenge to her/his worldview. I have followed the Intelligent Design/Darwinism debate closely, and it's the Darwinists that are most guilty of "pretentious-and repetitive-arrogance."
__label__2 Another excellent dragon author: I am a fan of great Dragon Series, I grew up on Ann Macaffey, Naomi Novik has hit the spot.
__label__2 I love this stuff!!: This lotion is moisturizing without being greasy, and, after several months of use the skin on my face and neck looks firmer and the fine lines around my eyes are disappearing. I am prone to breakouts, and this product has always left my skin clear and healthy-looking. I swear by this cream!
__label__1 Shalimar Eau De Parfum: Shalimar is the only perfume/cologne I wear, mainly because my husband loves it. I ordered this because it was sold by Amazon and not an Amazon merchant, and it was a great price. I opened it today and it is either fake, or a very old bottle. It doesn't smell at all like Shalimar. I am not worried that Amazon will refund my money, just disappointed that I have to hassle with getting a refund. I ordered it going by the positive reviews, so maybe this was just a fluke. Still, "buyer beware!"
__label__1 Here a hint get some real Flemish speakers: Being Flemish myself I know how little my own language has changed the people singing here don't the first thing about it, and think they are singing German, by the way not the same thing. If you are looking for real Flemish medieval songs, this would not be it, the songs are OK not to great as far as medieval music goes, yet it is entertaining. I would say learn Flemish if you are going to sing it please so I can actually understand you when you sing. I othere then that if you don't care about being able to understand then I guess you will like it
__label__1 Any redeeming qualities?: It is very seldom that I can find no redeeming qualities for a film. Did anyone write a script? This film has little plot and trite dialog. Were there any rehearsals? The acting was poor, accents were phony, speech was poorly articulated (mumbled), and sword fights were awkward. It reminded me of watching 12-year-old boys with heavy sticks pretending to be warriors. Yawn.
__label__2 teaching mom: This is a great cd and I enjoyed having it downloaded instantly. Selah is a great group to listen to and I'm glad that I have it.
__label__1 A rather disppointing book by Lindsey.: This is not one of Lindsey's better writings. I was disappointed in it as a whole. The storyline wasn't well worked out. I also felt the characters fall into love was to fast with all the conflicts and culture differences. It wasn't really believable, leaving a person wonder at what they missed(in between the lines). This book is easily left behind after reading.
__label__2 Unputdownable!: This book presents a fantastically detailed world that I can see in my mind and enter into just by picking it up. I feel like I've known the main characters forever, as if they are family. The length of this book (and its predecessor) is daunting but manageable for this slow reader. When I am reading this book, time flies and I am lost to the current world and immersed the world of the book. Very few books have this effect on me. I have not watched the TV series, nor do I feel the need to. The book has taken me there already!
__label__2 Read this Book!: This Saddle Club book is one of the best. Carole, Stevie, and Lisa all try to think to be totally selfless. Stevie's of course is to try and be nice to Veronica. Lisa doesn't know what to do. In the end it turns out that Lisa does something completely selfless to help one of Pine Hollow's favorite horses. It's kind of sad. You might cry a little but I think that it was a great book
__label__1 thin on photos,emaciated on bio- ,but nice cover and typeset: I expected thin - the book is thin - but emaciated? The author himself says the book was proposed as a picture book and yet the book is thin on illustrations and thin on biographical info, and flat writing for such a iconic woman. What accompanying "biographical" info there is, is really only cursory and focuses more on her singing than her acting. (one more mention of che sera sera and I'll go nuts -- and isn't it spelled "que sera sera"??). "Illustrated biography" is hardly a fitting title. The book would have been more aptly marketed as a book superficially chronicling Doris Day's singing credits. The only insightful editorializing the authors puts forth are quotes from Doris's autobiography.
__label__1 Sooo dissapointed: I got this book because it had such awesome reviews. I'm going to be taking a test in the near future, and you're allowed to use a medical dictionary, and I picked this one.I've been taking practice tests. On the first practice test I took, the first 6 out of 7 medical terms I tried to look up weren't in the book. I was stunned, and several of them were pretty basic words that I just wanted to get a very clear definition of.I'm not sure it's even going to be worth lugging this book to the test, or even keeping the book. I may just sell it and try another book.Jane
__label__1 Not A Good Machine: The presser foot keeps falling off, the thread breaks constantly and it is very noisy. I have checked the settings and everything appears to be correct, but I still am having problems. The machine that I thought would bring enjoyable is totally frustrating.
__label__2 Heinlein's done it again: Yet another work of art from Heinlein himself. I've read some other novels by him (Starship Troopers, The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, Red Planet) and this one is great! It's like driving through the brain of a mental patiant. With great works of sci fi and old stories.. It's fun to read over and over again.
__label__2 Hardbop Masterpiece: This is the first Jazz Messengers album which soon would go under the tutelage of Art Blakey. From there (read the book Hardbop Academy) the group would go through many line up changes and launch the careers of musicians from inspired (Wayne Shorter) to derivative (Wynton Marsalis) and many in between. This has to be my favorite Jazz Messengers album because most of the pieces on it would become jazz standards. Adding elements of soul and later funk to bebop to create the sub-genre known as hardbop does not sound like much today but it was an act to take away the idea of jazz as music for purely intellectuals and return it to its roots but still keeping it advancing in a new direction. Ever jazz musician with any degree of awareness would name check this album. But forgot the hyperbole. If you are a fan of classic hardbop, sooner or later you will run into this album and when you do, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.
__label__2 Siscle and Ebert must give it TWO THUMBS UP!!: This is one amazing piece of work. This is one of the best CDs of the '90's, I recomed it to any one. It is a must have in any collecters collection.Every one in the band is soo talented, they all have amazed me. Jonny Greenwood has to be one of the most talented guitarists of the 90's. They all have alot of talent and a good sound which is a must for any new band.They have a sound of their own, I wouldnt catorgorize it. Thom has a amazing voice.Radiohead is the best Band Ever!!!
__label__2 Endearing Tale of a Minstrel and His Favorite Pet: Rosemary Sutcliff is a superb writer, she has taken many of the ancient classics like the Iliad and Odyssey and brought them to a child level without losing the content and poetry of the stories.Here, she has written a book for elementary age children and like always had made it a very well told tale.The minstrel's dragon pup is stolen from him one night at an inn and a long time later he finds his dragon at a king's menagerie and he wants the dragon back without incurring the wrath of the king. This story is endearing and any child will relate to the relationship between a favored pet and a young boy.The illustrations, as in all her books, are excellent. Rosemary Sutcliff manages to entertain the adult reading aloud as well as the child, and that makes for a very good children's book.
__label__1 Disappointing!: This book is actually a patchwork of vignettes dealing with urban topics. There is no continuity and no actual discussion of the topics introduced as chapter headings. These simply provide a starting point for presenting two or three specific stories. Though some are of interest, the lack of overall framework makes the book rather pointless.The layout is hopelessly antiquated with all (black and white) illustrations concentrated in four series of unnumbered pages placed at regular intervals in the main text.There can be no reason to recommend this collage to anyone.
__label__1 Piece of crap.: I probably have used this blender 6 or 7 times. I wanted to make a smoothie for breakfast this morning and it broke. I was very surprised and disappointed. Yes, it is the same part that everyone else seems to have a problem with, the clutch assembly, cracked while trying to chop frozen berries. I thought about getting a replacement clutch assembly but since reading these reviews I don't think I will bother. I guess I will just get a different blender altogether.
__label__1 Terrible quality: The quality of the scanning is so terrible that the book is essentially unreadable. Absolutely not worth the money. I had ready deleted it right away.
__label__2 Very slim: Very slim DVD case, maybe a little bit too much. There is no room for a label on the side of the case.
__label__2 Been using for two years, works great: Saw this on Queer Eye back in it's early days. Thought I would try something healthy for my hair since I am in my mid-30's and have been using alcohol based stuff for 20 years. I would give it 5 stars but your timing for this product has to be spot-on. It doesn't work when your hair is bone dry nor does it work when it is soaking wet. Somewhere in the middle, it works like a charm. I am going to try some of the Sharps stuff next and see if it is any better.I will say that the price is right, I use a pea sized glob of it per day and one jar seems to last about 4-6 months. My hair is just your average businessmans cut, fairly short. The shorter the cut, the better it works. Does leave a strangely greasy feel to hair but its better than gel or hairspray.
__label__2 Almost, but not quite the original: Is anyone else a little disappointed in some of the episodes? My main complaint is about "BE TRUE TO YOUR SCHOOL". In the original TV episode there were some great songs used at the high school reunion (Wild Thing, Day Tripper). This recording has some lame ballad playing.When Cody is consoling Nick about his buddies being drug dealers the original had Yesterday playing in the background. It was so corny you had to love it. In this factory release there is total silence. What a let-down.But the most shocking was that nowhere in the episode did they use the title song "Be True to Your School", whereas in the original it was used twice.....just before the drug runner's boat blew up on the water, and most importantly at the end where Nick re-visits the football stadium.I for one am keeping my old recording handy just so I never forget how it is really supposed to be.
__label__1 Not for early readers: I have to agree with all the negative reviews. I started the first book, and within a couple of pages, Junie was contemplating beating up another child! My six-year-old daughter had her heart set on reading these books, so we moved on to a different one. In the next book, Junie soon told us about how she "Runned" around her room. Hmmm, do I want to teach my daughter bad behavior and bad grammer?Fans of slapstick comedy movies will probably enjoy these books. But, ask yourself, do you let your children watch those movies?Try the Magic Treehouse series. It's great!
__label__2 Another wonderful 3rd Party seller: I bought this collector's edition on the day it was released. Then I loaned it to a friend. Yeah, that worked out well.I took a chance on this seller and cannot praise them enough. The quality was far better than I expected and was unopened--completely brand-new.As of this point, this collector's set will sell for more than 100USD. I received a tremendous deal on my favorite film and it was brand-new. Can't beat that. I recommend this seller heart and soul.
__label__1 Quality control: Two of the 8 corners that must be assembled were faulty. They had bumps inside from bad welds that blocked the tubes from being inserted. DH fixed it in the shop with a drill, but otherwise I'd have had to return it.
__label__2 Simple - shold have bought earlier: I bought this a few years ago and two years later decited to write a review. I am not a photo geek, just a person with 2 little kids. I always hated taking picturers indoor due to lighing conditions (not enough and dislike flash). This lense solves the issue. Picts are fantastic indoor and out. I wish I would have had this when kids were toddlers. I was a little concerned not having zoom, but find I typically crop pictures as needed. Great lense and well worth the invetment.
__label__1 Does not clamp!: This product isn't really a clamp, It's just a pretty sheath that doesn't even slip over a clamp! It is completely useless.
__label__1 What a let down...: ..just a let down since the first two movies where whimsical and fun.. and in Live Action.Nope, didn't like it one bit.
__label__1 Servers are down: The PC and PS2 servers were shut down. Nothing will run. The game won't even allow single player story mode. This should be removed.
__label__2 Pearl: I truly enjoyed this book. The way the author writes, keeps wanting to more. Very good series book. Anyone who reads this book will be in for a special voyage
__label__2 Teen finds her way: After getting used to the style of writing, I truly enjoyed this book. The organization was scattered using flashbacks and present story telling, but kept the pace pretty quick. It was interesting to see where the Phoebe storyline was going and how it all tied together in the end. I don't want to give anything away, but I think Sam's way of dealing with situation will help the young reader to deal with theirs.
__label__1 Technical problem in DVD production: DVDs 4,5,6 do not run on my dvd player because of blocked dvd-area code for Europe (Germany).DVDs 1,2,3 are running perfectly.
__label__1 IZ: Fun if you have a young male child that isnt into the music... it fart and burps and makes annoying noises during the music. not the toy for me but i think little boys would find it funny (but i do see it getting old quick)
__label__2 Razor Scooter: I am very pleased with the prompt shipment and the quality of this product. It was a big hit with my grandchild for Christmas.
__label__1 WOW! I thought I was the only 1...: The trimmer seemed like a good idea in the package.. Though the blades dont cut very well.. I found yself going through the same spots over and over.. Does not work well with hair longer than 1/8 inch. So the long hair attachments in my opinion are pretty much useless. works decent for nose and eyebrow trimming.. I would spend a little more and get a different unit.
__label__1 Dull and disappointing: I have read all of Fanny Flagg's other books and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. I have now read the first 150 pages and I am still waiting for it to kick into gear. I picked it up and put it down several times already. What is the point? Where is the story? What is to laugh about? This book is deadly dull. I cannot punish myself by reading further.
__label__2 A album that makes me want to cry,laugh,and smash my windows: Glassjaw sends you on the a roller coaster through hell and back. With Daryl's bi-polar singing, juicy guitar riffs, and a great dummer; Glassjaw are going to lead the kids after the deftones gracefully step down from the throne of Hardcore.
__label__1 One fatal flaw: When I found this watch, and even for the first couple days I wore it, I thought it was a 5 star product. I was completely happy until the first day I wore it to work. I'm a critical care nurse and have to be able to GLANCE at my watch ALL the time. Simply put, with this watch you can't. The viewing angle for this display is dismal. I can't wear it to work. I really wanted to like this product, and if the viewing angle isn't a big deal then by all means get it. For what I need it didn't work. I realize this is a highly personalized review, but I feel like it's worth mentioning. Hope this helps.
__label__2 Drum Dolly: Purchase experience was great...It came fully assembled...Good thing because the shipping container was toast...The product was unharmed, works like it should. At least with an empty barrel. May take years to fill with waste oil. I use it to position a barrel under my personal lift to drain oil directly into the barrel. Works great. May never wear out.LKD
__label__1 Cheap Junk: This can opener worked fairly well when brand new, but the cutting performance quickly deteriorated. It is now more than a year old and simply will not open a can. The removable cutting assembly has frozen up and does not puncture or cut the can. This product is a waste of money at any price.
__label__2 Eric Liddell: Something Greater Than Gold: Did you like the movie, "Chariot's of Fire"? If so, you will love this book of the life story of Eric Liddell. It is well written & will strengthen your faith.
__label__2 THE GOLDEN AGE !: The golden age of British metal is well represented with this CD by Saxon. It has great tunes. hard and tough. Ironically, the tittle track "Wheels of Steel", albeit being a classic, is the one I like the lesser, because it has only one riff through all the song.
__label__2 Good Read: Although this story has been done before, I thought I'd give it a try and found the book to be suspenseful as well as romantic and a good read. Recommended!
__label__2 Great fence for the Money: As with many of the reviewers of this product I was considering the $400+ type of rip fence for my 10 yr old Craftsman contractor saw. I oppted for this one thinking if it didn't suit me I would just be out $200 and then go buy the more expensive one.I'm very pleased to say it was easily adapted to my saw and I love it. I have two cast aluminum table extensions on my saw with slotted holes that fit the front rail and I drilled 2 more holes in the edge of the cast iron saw table to match the center holes in the rail to make 4 total bolts for stability. An easy retrofit for a product was made to fit a Delta saw.
__label__2 The Complete Potter, Throwing: The book itself is not of quality binding, but the information contained within is. A good book for beginners and begin-again-ers. Processes are described step by step with excelent photos or line drawing examples.
__label__1 Wish List: I found this book very boring. I found tha language used was effective but this did not overcome the fact that the jokes made where very lame. I found it very hard to get into this book.One of the very few things i like in this bok was the relationships, such as Beelzebub and Saint Peter or Frankie and Meg. Remember this is my own personal review and you can think what you like.
__label__2 Kindergarten teacher: It certainly makes sense to associate a letter with an object with that beginning sound. Also, five year olds enjoy acting out the letters! I love the little hedgehog. This would be a great addition to any preschool or kindergarten class.
__label__2 Kuhn Y peeler: I have used my peeler for over 10 years and have found it to be the best, the sharpest, and the easiest to get into tight spaces (such as around baby carrot tops). I have searched local stores purchasing at least 6 potential replacements over the years and the closest match is a Japanese ceramic Y which is 4X the cost. The others have been passed on to friends and relatives (and a few enemies). A great value. Having read the other review, I concur with the weight observation; but find that I prefer the light weight.
__label__2 Devotion to One's Daughter Brings Joy and Grief: Wow! This is an amazing book.The reader takes an incredible journey with a mother who devotes her life to her developmentally disabled daughter. She is a woman of depth, singularity and authenticity of purpose who believes that her life is due to God's will. She both embraces and grieves her life for, with her devotion to her daughter Brenda Kay, comes the letting go of her dreams for another type of family.This book is beautifully, lyrically and painfully conveyed.
__label__2 Helpful if you like houseplants and want better air: Bought the book due to a magazine review. No disappointments even after reading in the magazine much of the information contained in the book. Book has more good information about what type of plants to use in certain areas, ease to grow, how each kind of houseplant helps clean the air in it's space. Good reference for anyone interested in experimenting with improving air quality around them at work or home.
__label__1 What kind of album is this?: waste of money and pure garbage. he is a true hip pop artist. wack wack wack. go buy some Mobb Deep or Nas.
__label__2 the next generation of Punky fans: Its great to have these dvds to share with my girls, age 8 and 2 1/2. They watch Sabrina and got a kick out of watching Punky. My 8 year old loves to watch them because she know Punky was one of my favorite shows, when I was about her age. I'm a young mom, my daughter also has friends with moms my age and they all know Punky. Punky was an important part of our past - who didn't try to walk out ofthe house with two different sneakers on. Sharing my past with my girls is important, we also bought DUKES OF HAZZARD SEASON ONE for my husband to share with the girls. I know one of my moms favorite shows as a kid was I LOVE LUCY. To me that stuff is important, the people we love won't always be here - but a suttle reminder of who the were is always nice.
__label__2 Thankful: I was very suprised by the ecclectic mix of styles on this album. From sultry to bluesy, from quiet sincerity and laid back subtlety to a funky rock flavor, her voice is amazing and versatile and the songs exhibit that. Awesome job....she rocks on this album!!!
__label__2 Wonderful for this event planner: I'm a wedding and event planner, and these are great to hold information about individual events. I put a different subject tab with each folder - "catering", "rentals", etc, to keep everything organized. There's spaces for vendor cards and cds/dvds and a big notepad, which really comes in handy. It only gets 4 stars because there's no pen holder, but other than that, it's perfect.
__label__2 Crossing Delancey: Life is like that. Sometimes the things we are searching for are right under our noses or waiting for us in Grandmas kitchen as our heroine Izzy discovers. There are too many of us seduced by things that are superficial in this world,trying to create a glamorous image for ourselves that only finds us living alone in an empty flat. I saw this movie and made many changes to my life. No more jerks. Found a lovely kind caring man just across the street. It sure worked for me
__label__2 Cetaphil Theraphutic Hand Cream: Quick service. Great product. Not able to purchase locally. Was recommended by a dermatologist for a skin rash on my right hand. The cream provides immediate and long term relief to my dry skin condition. I see a definite healing trend in progress.
__label__2 tintin books: We have been reading the TinTin books to my grandson since he was three (he is now five). He loves them. I do believe we have almost all of them. Amazon's prices on new paperbacks are better than Powell's.
__label__2 Nothing but the facts linked to mainstream sources: Raimondo is a very talented journalist who uses mainstream sources to connect the dots and raise awareness about what foreign governments are doing in America. He is a patriot and a Libertarian who follows in the steps of Murray Rothbard. His work ought to be gracing the pages of the New York Times but alas the press barons would rather keep him out of site than give him the audience he deserves.
__label__1 So Disappointing: I am one of Mr. Serv-On's biggest fans, but there is no way in the World that I could convince myself that this album was any good...there were only two tight songs....#2 & 6, and it just wasn't hittin' like Life Insurance was...maybe next time.
__label__2 TO GOOD TO BE TRUE: THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE TO THE WORLD , I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU SOME DAY YOU ARE GREAT
__label__2 Overall, highly recommended: A couple of caveats - no dust cover, completely manual operation, plastic housing. On the other hand, my first effort was highly successful. Made a CD with miniumum effort. If you have a laptop, the best thing is to connect the turntable to your home audio system, and connect the USB output to a laptop - that way, you don't have to worry above moving the turntable to your computer. In my case, I don't have a burner on my laptop, but it is part of a home network, so I saved the audio file to my desktop computer and worked from there. There is a learning curve to the software (works well on Win XP), but once you're over it, it's smooth sailing.
__label__2 Awesome!: Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut. If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12. Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised. I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby. It's very healthy and low in sugar. Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices.
__label__1 Item defective on receive!: Item isn't working. Amazon says contact vendor. Contacted vendor and still waiting for a response. Was expecting better service and protection from Amazon, but obviously they are just a storefront.
__label__1 Imaginative Writing: The Elements of Craft (Penguin Academics Series): I received the item in a timely manner. However, upon opening the box, I was disappointed to find that this gently used book was actually loved to pieces. The cover was almost torn off and the book was missing several pages. Not Cool!
__label__1 Color comb - Black: Cover Your Gray Color Comb - BlackThis is the worst product I have ever purchased through Amazon.com. Infact I have 9 unused packets of this color combs. I would be really appreciated if Amazon.com will return my money back. I would want to tell all my freinds and collegues not to purchase this bad product. It is a waist of my money and time. I am really upset about this product. Infact I have lost my trust in Amazon.com items. If you can help me re-establish my trust with your products by returning my money back I would really appreciate that. Please reply to me.I would rate this item as zero stars. I even don't want to rate this product. Such a bad product.Anthony AmaratungeEmail:primrose@uw.edu
__label__1 Good sound, Bad construction: I used to be a avid BOSE earphone user. I absolutely loved their product until it started breaking down and I was sick of replacing it through their warranty program. Ever since then I gave Monster a try and to my surprise, the sound quality is actually better in the sense that the mids and lows are more crisp than my previous BOSE set.But unfortunately much like the pair of BOSE earphones, these Monster in ear speakers started breaking down as well. In the 6 months of owning and enjoying this product, I have exchanged TWO PAIRS of these darn ear buds!It came to the point where I am privy to carry a backup pair of BOSE just in case these Monster's break again and I have to ship it back to them and wait couple of weeks to get another pair.
__label__2 Drier belt: The product arrived promptly. We have been using it for about a year with an average of a load a day and no issues. The price is right and free shipping, I'd buy it again. Drier belts take a bit of thinking to install!
__label__1 Disappointing.: Like the other posters, I too was given this book as part of our homestudy for adopting a child from China. After reading the first chapter I found myself insulted. This book assumes all who read it are adopting because they cannot get pregnant, which is not my case. While infertility is something that should not be ignored, and I appreciate the fact that most adoption books I read address the matter, this book would have been much more respectable if it did not direct its text to the reader as a person who cannot conceive. I was so insulted that I returned the book to my social worker with these concerns.
__label__1 Children should watch "The Chronicles of Narnia Instead": Having seen Lord Of The Rings & Harry Potter Movies, I was mystified how it has such a large following. I thought it was a bunch of purple-prosed jibberish with a fragmented, weak plot. Not to mention the other detrimental negative apects of the questionable handling of the magic/occult.Having seen The Chronicles of Narnia; I think I can understand why the world would play up LOTR & Harry.Narnia is such a magnificent work with thematic purpose that the prince of this world would attempt to overshadow it as an inferior comtemporary work compared to Tolkien's LOTR jibberish or Harry Potter confusing nonsense.C.S. Lewis was a Christian and his work "The Chronicles of Narnia" is powerful.Children should see Narnia - especially "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe". Parents will be accountable to what they expose their children to.
__label__1 wow.: David Maslanka's 'Mountain Roads' is a fantastic piece. If only the quartet could play in tune. What an awful representation of a great piece.
__label__1 OMG! FORGET IT! Work at your own pace, unless you are their age!: I am in my late 40's and have always been in shape until recently. I really was hoping for something to kickstart me back into shape, but THIS IS SOOOOOOOO NOT MY ANSWER. All the people in the video are young and ripped.I did the first few exercises and did the butt kick and felt a sharp stab in my left knee.I stopped and bringing it back to our library.Suggestion... Get it from your library first and try it out before you buy? Maybe you will love it, but I would much rather work at my own pace. They tell you not to sacrifice form, but you try to keep up and then the form is blown.Sorry, but it would be insanity if I kept doing this. This was NOT for me. Going back to Margaret Richard and Body Electric
__label__2 This is not the answer to "Waiting to Exhale": This was definitely a page turner but it wasn't the answer to "Waiting to Exhale". To be the answer to "Waiting to Exhale", Carl needed to depict men as victims. Even though the woman in Carl's novel were trifling, their actions were reactions. This book was lengthy, however, Carl was able to keep us intrigued. The storyline was as close to reality as you can get.
__label__2 Primary source of a New World traveler: Catalina de Erauso is an unusual figure in world history : a runaway nun who successfully concealed her gender and navigated the business and military structures of hertime. She's a swashbuckler and an eye level view of Spanish society in Peru in the 1600s. Historians believe that, mostly likely, much of this book was actually written by this remarkable person. I'd reccomend it as an enjoyable and quick read offering a first hand view of the past.
__label__2 World of Wonder by Baby Explorer: This creatively crafted, strikingly beautiful and developmentally sensitive video, provides the most scientifically formed and rich presentation currently available for young children. This visual and auditory experience is certain to enhance positive infant cognitive, emotional and social development.It offers an extraordinary opportunity for parents to promote their children's healthy and successful development."Dr. Richard M. Lerner, Director of Applied Developmental Science at Tufts University
__label__2 Awesome remote.: This is the first universal remote I have owned and I love it. I had 4 remotes (TV, DVR, CD/DVD, VCR) and it replaced them all. I love the one touch button function to play a movie or watch TV. Great for my wife that doesn't know what remote goes with what and what each device needs to be set at. Also, nice color screen and feels great in your hand. The only reason I didn't get it 5 stars is the fact that you do have to make sure it beeps when you put in in the docking station or it will not charge. The docking station could be a little better, but still not bad. The other reason is the buttons. They all feel the same and are all pretty smooth between one another, so it's real easy to push the wrong button. Over all, I would recommend this to others. It was between this one and the Harmony One, but this has more 1 touch functions compared to the that remote.
__label__2 The best ever!: I have used many other brands of loaf/bread pans and Wilton is THE BEST by far. It cooks evenly and lightly browns the loaves of bread. I have been making my own bread for about 40 years. Now that I have found the Wilton Excelle Elite loaf pan, I will not use any other!!!
__label__1 Agreed: Just read the two below this one. I caught the last 30 minutes on cable waiting for something else to start, and everthing except the bald guy is grade-school amateur stuff.
__label__2 KillingFloor -GOOD: A good friend recommended the Lee Child books to me this year. Coincidentally, the Jack Reacher movie came out this month too. I enjoyed the book so much that I intend to purchase and read all the rest of the Jack Reacher series. If you are a fan of crime fiction, you'll love these books. My husband is interested in reading them too. I was told that you do not need to read them in order, although it helps, so I plan to read them in order.
__label__1 Poor Battery Attachment: This item was given to me as Christmas Gift in 2007. The tool works fine but the major complaint I have is that the battery will not stay in the tool! I have been using my corded dremel for the past ten years and finally worn it out. I had expected the same performance with this item but was greatly dissapointed.
__label__1 Very Boring: A really badly written story,the events do not flow smoothly with too many unnecessary sexual encounters described. It's definitely too long with very boring details. The characters are all unrealistically extreme. I can't think of anything positive to say about this supposedly great saga.
__label__1 Why?!!: I wanted this to be good. The end is absurd and boring. It is so shallow. I read through the whole thing hoping something would redeem it. What a waste!!! Read Dune instead.
__label__2 Good Anime: If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it, so its rare I ever complaint about it. Good series having played the games you will enjoy it more. Art style is diffrent its a good different nice change . For the price I paid 13 bucks its worth it
__label__2 Rock solid on XP: What a great piece of software. Installed easily (on XP), loads fast and handles everything I throw at it. I've had the unfortunate life experience of being a "software tester" since 1980-something. Vegas MS+DVD ranks way up there on my list of software that does a lot for me, without me having to do a lot for it.Contrary to what I read in several product reviews, the learning curve was just about non-existant. If you have the computer skills to be reading this review, then you should be able to run Vegas just fine.The one negative I had was my fruitless search for "velocity envelopes" (a controller curve that allows for variable play-back speed). The help menu indicates this feature is available. However after much searching, I've concluded that it simply does not exist in this product. I believe this was an artifact from the help menu for the higher end product.Regardless, a great product.
__label__2 Photodex - ProShow Gold: An excellent product. The manual provided touches only on the very basic items in the program. It would be nice to see an expanded manual with specific directions for each feature.
__label__1 A bizarre record: Pierre Henry's electronics sound very abrasive. I like a lot of the musique concrete records from Nonesuch like Stockhausen and Xenakis, but I haven't warmed to this. I guess I was expecting things to...gell more. From a prog-rock perspective, I actually prefer both of the Electric Prunes releases more than this because the David Axelrod production is so crisp and clear. As another entry in a short-lived experimental, and somewhat lost era of rock, perhaps it is worth another listen.
__label__2 Gardena flow control nozzle: I've been using these hose nozzles for almost 10 years and I really like them. They work well and have great "feel" but, unfortunately, they're somewhat fragile. Figure on replacing it annually, maybe once every 2 years if you're REALLY careful. One drop onto concrete from waist height and it'll break. Leave the water on 24/7 and the pressure will crack the body. Still, they're light and the plastic body means less potential for paint damage when washing your car. Despite the fragile factor I keep buying these because I haven't found a nozzle I like better.
__label__1 Mine doesn't work.: I bought 2 of these, didn't need to use them until after the return period ended. I admit I seem to have lost one of them, but the one I still have does not work. Tried it on 3 different computers. They are cheap so it may have cost more to return it than what it was worth, anyway. Maybe my other one works, but I can't find it. Will add a comment or change this review if I find the lost one.
__label__2 Horrific happiness: I bought this book on a whim. I wasn't expecting what I read. I couldn't put it down. It has been along time since I read something full of such detail. I truly enjoyed this book and since have had several of my friends read it. They feel the same way. I wasn't even aware of what I was reading until the end. I thought it was one thing and it turned out to actually be a completely different kind of book. If you enjoy exciting details and thrilling endings this is the book for you!!!!
__label__1 Poor mount and customer service: I live overseas in the Netherlands and have to have a GPS to get around. I puchased a Tom Tom 910, paid top dollar, and was expecting to get the best. 3 months later the mount breaks, so I took it back to the shop I bought it at and had it replaced (1yr warranty). 6 months later the new mount breaks. Took it back to the shop and they told me Tom Tom will not replace the mount because Tom Tom said I am taking it off the windshield incorrectly. They don't even know how I take it off the windshield, BUT I have consumer reports stating how defective there mounts are. This is an example of how a company is trying to save money when they built a crappy product. I would not suggest Tom Tom for this reason.
__label__1 Poor information: I recently purchased a quick books Pro 4.0. Nowhere in the decription did it say it only worked on an old mac and not with the new operating system.shame on you for this bad transparency of information . I feel like I was ripped off.
__label__1 Works half the time: Product is physically made well, however I pick up all sorts of interference, most of the time I just get static.
__label__2 a tribute that doesn't suck!: while gary numan certainly had his place in my coming of age, i was never one of his rabid fans. perhaps that's why i find this tribute so refreshing and fun.saint etienne's "stormtrooper in drag" is worth the price of admission alone. this is the happiest dance song i've heard in a very long time. the chorus is infectious. you'll be humming it for days.towering inferno's "metal" has a certain ethereal shoegazing quality and borderlines on experimental. it's painful and lush.dubstar's "everyday i die" is pure jangle manna. heartbreak never felt so delicious.dave clarke's ironic "cars" cover (essentially a remix of the original) brings the compliation full circle to the present, offering gary his 15 minutes of retro-fame in all it's overproduced glory.like all tributes, this one is filled with its share of duds. biggest disappointment is no cover of "cry, the clock said," my fav numan track. overall, though, i recommend this to numan purists and the curious alike.
__label__2 Better than expected: This CD rocks, and actually has me excited again about music. I would put it this way: If GnR's Appetite for Destruction and STP's Core got together and had a kickass kid, it would be Contraband. I say that because, you can sense a little of both in it, but it is still it's own album, and it rocks from beginning to end. BUY IT, it's worth it.Suggested Use:Listen to 3 times a day.Common Side Effects:Urge to drink hard liquor and drive at excessive speeds.
__label__1 If I could give it 0 stars I would.: This book was a bore! I read lot of books during my pregnancy and this one was THE WORST! The "Girlfriend" who wrote it is full of herself and not every pregnant woman wants to be pregnant with a nasty attitude! I threw my copy away! Go get What To Expect When You Are Expecting. At least it is full of educated opinions and fact. This woman wrote about things she obiously had no real information on. This book is all opinion and no fact! If you read through What To Expect as quickly as I did you will need a book for the second half of your pregnancy... go get What To Expect From The First Year and What To Expect From the Todddler Years. Like in school it is always good to read the chapter before hand.. so go for it!
__label__2 Good and filling: These are a great bar for high protein, low sugar, and they actually taste good. My kids have them for pre-game snacks and I've even had them as an on-the-go lunch.
__label__1 Not for high-level workouts: The main point of this review is to warn users to protect the player from sweat. Perhaps put it over clothing rather than under ... or strap it to the stairmaster. I used this for about a year. ... and, yes, I agree with the other reviewers that it is a temperamental unit. It took a while, but I eventually got it running. Philips support line is rather weak. I felt as though I knew more about the system when calling. I used a different pair of headphones (the ones supplied are weird!). At first I noticed that the battery was getting corroded. So I tried to dry it off after all uses (I used it on 5-7 mile runs). It didn't seem to work too well. Now, one year later, the only button that works is the on-off switch. I can add music ... but no volume control, fast-forward or rewind. I am looking into the Rio Cali unit
__label__1 Makes you wonder: Western women keep publishing garbage like this book, and then they wonder why Western men are so reluctant to marry them.
__label__1 Only one use: I used this pan one time before it broke. The latch used to tighten it bent because the side grooves wouldn't slide over the bottom piece smoothly. Now the pan won't close at all. A waste of money.
__label__1 I'm disapointed to say the least: This film is perfect and magical in every way,but if the dvd specifications are correct,WHERE is the DTS ES 6.1 transfer?There is no other way to see this film,you need that extra surround back channel to fully appreciate this masterpiece(2 speakers behind the listener).They got everything else right with this dvd,but they dropped the ball big time with the sound transfer.I'll wait to see if a 6.1 DTS transfer wil be offered.As a result some audio information from the master print will have to be deleted in order to accomodate the DD 5.1 track.There are sounds found in the original that will not be on the DVD.
__label__2 Faceless Knight- Papo: Papo has wonderful toys. Our son plays with his knights all the time. This knight's hand fell off the second day. We could not get it to stay on. We have not had this problem with any of the other Papo products.
__label__2 Bel Indeed!: Bel Canto is an utterly beautiful book, at times almost funny, at times heart-rending. It tells the story of more than 200 people who are held hostage, from a magnificent opera soprano, to a wealthy Japanese businessman and his translator, to the hostage-takers. Patchett has compassion for all her characters-- in this story she brings each of them amazingly alive. And her writing is so beautiful. But never more beautiful than it is right here.
__label__2 Great Charger for didital camera use: I bought this charger for use with my digital camera (Canon Powershot). I love it, it charges relatively quickly and shuts off when fully charged so there is no risk of over charging the batteries. I have not noticed the unit becoming hot or even warm during charging as someone else comented on. It is very compact which makes it easy to travel with. As it has dual voltage with the right converter you can use it anywhere. I have used mine in Ireland, England and New Zealand with no problems. The ability to charge either 2 or 4 batteries is also a nice feature. In my camera the batteries have what I find to be a good amount of life before they need to be recharged. I have accidentally popped the cover off when opening but it pops back on just as easily. I am completely satisfied with this charger and batteries for digital camera usage and recommend it.
__label__1 NOT OEM: Discription said OEM but turned out to be a cheap non-OEM product. Fell apart about a week after I got it.
__label__2 greatest Les Claypool side project: I just want to give this album a 5-star review so that it isn't below purple onion. Les's side projects, in my opinion, are all good. Oysterhead is definately my favorite and I will not let it be underneath the Frog Brigade. I believe The Grand Pecking Order to be the lightest and airiest album that I own. It is perfect chill music.
__label__1 Roitman reviews Kathryn: well, kathryn didn't quite get the gist of it. She plays excessively on the conservative side rather that really getting that piano to have free expression. Why didn't she just wham it out like George wanted her to. Too pretty, not the revolutionary kind of playing that Gershwin gave license to. Still, she has skill and I enjoyed it. But not an investment grade George Gershwin for me. Irwin Roitman
__label__2 Disney 80 Days Are More Fun: I cant actually believe someone said stick to the original. Let me say up front my wife and I are in our 50s. Next let me point out I just re-rented the original so we could see it again. Although it has reasonable acting and beautiful scenery, we were so bored by the end of the first disc, we didnt bother to watch the second disc. I immediately returned both so we could rent this one. We had seen parts of this on TV. It has more action and is much shorter, so it wont bore you to tears like the other one. Sorry but I will take this Disney version over the original or the Pierce Brosnan version any day.
__label__2 Fast & as advertised: This series is a favorite of mine. I discovered the series while livingin Hawaii in. my youth. Very enjoyable.
__label__2 Old Mother West Wind: I bought this for my Kindle. I am 73 and remember my mother reading it to me when I was very young.
__label__2 Stunning: The picture alone does this topper no justice whatsoever. It is absolutely beautiful from every angle. When in the light, the shadows created on this piece create such depth. It is, truly, beautiful. We couldn't be happier.
__label__1 what was all the hype?: this movie, though cute left me a little flat. it was not nearly as funny as ice age and monster's inc.. thou ellen degeneres was very funny as the spacy fish the movie just kind of fell flat in my opinion
__label__2 Good sport watch: I bought this watch to replace my old Casio digital watch. I do workout during the weekend and I found it is very useful when timing laps. The memory can hold 30 laps which is good enough for me. It is light and well-designed. It can fit my wrist comfortably when jogging and swimming. In general, I like it very much. I think my next watch will be a Timex, too.
__label__1 The non-non-stick griddle: Too bad I can't give this a ZERO. After one use, one section of the "non-stick" felt rough. Soon after that everything stuck. I have used pans and griddles for years and never had one this BAD. Ditto the other reviews--even bacon sticks. I started the bacon on low--it stuck, medium--it stuck, high--it stuck. And I'm tired of serving scrambled pancakes to my family. What TRASH!
__label__2 Practical without being preachy.: Practical information in a non-threatening presentation. You'll love Ellen Minet's approach to the four seasons of rose gardening. For experts and novices alike.
__label__2 A Look Into The Past: This book gives an actual accounting of life around the time of the Civil War. The author describes what her life was like in a very interesting way. I highly recommend this book.
__label__2 New Love: I had been reading about echinacea for ages, but I finally decided to try it when I got sick. In addition to drinking tons of water, resting and taking vitamins I've been drinking this tea and I feel tons better. And I read some reviews about the taste - personally I love the taste! It tastes so good I want to start drinking it on a regular basis. It's a nice hot drink to have in the morning instead of coffee and it's tons better for you!I always make my tea with sugar and cream. I don't know how others make it - but adding sugar and cream makes it taste more like a drink than a tonic (which most teas taste like).
__label__2 I love this Coffee Mug!: Beside the fact that it arrived with a tiny dent in it (could have been caused during shipping), everything else was great. I really like that it is spill proof and that it keeps the beverage very warm for a good amount of time. I feel that this seller is trustworthy and give them an A+.
__label__1 Chemical cocktail that is anything but "natural": I originally felt that this product was really great and "natural". But, as I have come to find out this very un-natural product that I purchased on Amazon can seriously aggravate sensitive skin conditions. I also found out that some of the chemicals used in this product are very carcinogenic.
__label__2 last of the romantics?: here you have fabulous melodies, brilliant orchestration, the endorsement of the German Tea Party (the symphonies released in '41 & '45), and none of those pesky transitions, leading from one movement to the next, inherited from the baroque, passed through the classical, and only seriously challenged by Brahms and Dvorjak. Atterberg answered the challenge. He didn't altogether succeed.
__label__2 Happy with my purchase: I like this iron, it is powerful and heats up very quickly! Love the digital display too
__label__1 Oh My God: You know, this movie would not be so bad if its characters had a point. Yes, there are a load of characters from the MK3 game, but they don't explain where they come from, their significance in the plot, why the heck they're there! The dialog is as choppy as the plot, and I don't even know where the whole animality thing came from without reference to the games!!! The coolest characters in the movie were Jax, NightWolf, and that's just about it. AND JOHNNY!!! =(You know how sometimes you could just watch a movie and go "ugh... this is so bad"... this is one of them. I was very disappointed, considering how good the first one was.
__label__2 The Clinique of Hair Products: This mask definitely heals my hair. I have awful hair, so it's best for me to use it 3 times a week. I can actually brush my hair now without it puffing out ^^ And my split ends are noticeably healing. Definitely worth the money-on the web site it is around $60 and on amazon it is only $25 (for 16.9 oz) Definitely try it!
__label__2 Awesome!: The only word I can use to describe Nick Carter's new CD is -- awesome! I LOVE it! You can definitely tell a difference between this CD and those of Backstreet, but if you are\were a backstreet fan you will still love this CD. My favorite songs are "Do I Have to Cry for You" -- which Nick wrote himself, and is going to be the next single, and reminds me of a Bon Jovi song, "Blow Your Mind" -- which has a funky beat and definite rock-vibes, and "Who Needs the World" -- which is a ballad which is awesome. I've been listening to this CD non-stop since Tuesday and will continue to do so. If you haven't bought it yet, go out and get it now!!
__label__2 Best in the series!: Critters 2 is one of my all time favorite movies! Its even better than the first! they just don't make them like they used to! I was a bit suprised that this movie had nudity in it! and on the back of the case it said PG-13 but on the VHS it said PG. but anyways if you haven't seen this movie get off of the computer and go but it! Good luck finding it! i've seen the 1st one and borders on DVD and i bought the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th on VHS at hastings, and found the 1st one at Shopko on VHS for only $3.00! Oh and don't miss out on the critters subtitles! the one where the critter gets his hair blown off is so funny!
__label__2 Give credit where credit is due: This was a well made cd. I don't like all the songs, and I'm not much of a Justin fan. Without Timbaland and the neptunes and Brian McNight, Justin would not have been able to put out such a good cd. He's smart he tapped into the whole urban sound which helped push him over the top...good for him. Give the man credit it's a good cd.
__label__1 Time for Credibility/Reality check??: The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him 19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A 19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived, poorly written, and lacking any redeeming quality. Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set.
__label__1 smartboard isn't so smart: I was so excited to buy this for my almost 5 yr old son. It has been such a disappointment and a frustrating toy for both of us. If you don't write the letter correctly it doesn't recognize it. How do you explain to a little one who is trying so hard when the toy keeps telling him he is wrong? I would not recommend this toy and am very disappointed that I purchased it.
__label__2 The Lower (Manhattan) Depths: A superb history of NYC concentrating on the period from the mid-19th century to WWI. Really, it is the story of lower Manhattan, particularly the Lower East Side. Sante has uncovered the largely untold story of the working and under-classes. There is no shortage of books on the immigrant experience in NYC, but Sante doesn't romanticize their story: it is cobbled together from oral history, police reports, and other sources that "official" histories ignore.Perhaps most remarkably, Sante conveys an incredibly accurate, haunting and poetic sense of space. His description of the continuity of these streetcorners over two centuries is better than any I've read by a native.Even readers with no special interest in NYC should read this if only for the extraordinary description of the Civil War draft riot.
__label__1 Wedding Kit for Dummies: The wedding kit book constantly refers to chapters you should reread in the weddings for dummies book, so if you do not own BOTH books, it's useless. The wedding planner on the cdrom is only a demo version, and only allows you to add ten guests, and expires after a few weeks. I did however find some of the standard planning forms very useful, but you could find all and more of the info included in this book online if you really wanted to save yourself the money.
__label__1 Sick: It was intriguing at first, but as the movie went along it was terrible. It made me sick to watch this young girl create such violence. The other problem was that it was hard to really root for her because the plot didn't connect you with the actress, such as in good movies where you're really cheering the good guy on---I never knew who was the good guy or who was the bad guy. Would definitely NOT recommend this movie to anyone.
__label__2 How To Be Blown Away: In 1994 R. Kelly introduced us to Cassandra Lucas and Charisse Rose, better known as Changing Faces. Their very first single "Stroke You Up" had men everywhere saying "Yes you can." Then came "Foolin' Around", and with songs like that already out, people were wondering when the album was coming out.This album gives you a taste of solid R&B.; Silky ballads like the two aforementioned tracks are accompanied by songs like "Come Closer" and "Keep It Right There" as well as the two best tracks, "Thoughts Of You" and "All Is Not Gone". Not one song here is fast-forwardable.The only problem I could really see with this album is the lack of varied subject matter. For example, there are FOUR kick-your-man-to-the-curb songs ("Foolin' Around", "Am I Wasting My Time", "Movin' On" and "Good Thing"). Still, this album is a very good listen. Way to go, ladies!
__label__1 A CHRISTMAS gift for my daughters.: I bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the Dollar Tree. When i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures I decided to give them a try. I have two complaints with this product. One, the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and I could'nt get one of the phones to communicate. The pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone.
__label__1 squirrels thought this feeder was delicious...: This feeder is made of a plastic tube and plastic bottom. Pretty standard stuff aside from the thin copper top and thin copper bands near the openings. The quality wasn't what I'd imagined, but my expectations weren't that high when I ordered it. I was looking forward to the copper aging and eventually looking pretty cool.There's a distinct possibility that the squirrels in Maryland are just darned mean, but they disassembled this thing in roughly 4 hours. The feeder openings, to their minds, weren't big enough. So, they expanded them. When the copper got in the way, they just tore it lose. The openings became so sharp and jagged that I feared for all my critters' safety. The service life of this feeder was less than 2 days.Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on a good quality feeder, like one from droll yankees.
__label__1 Not very good as time goes on: The first 3 uses of this clipper worked well. Very easily to cut hair, cool to warm temperature of blade, looks good. After literally the 5th to present number of uses, the problems so far:1. The temperature of the blade becomes unbearably hot after about 15-20mins. It gets worst in the summer when its humid.2. The blade actually started to rust! Had to wipe off the rust repeatedly to remove it.I took care of this thing very well: oil blade before and after use, brush off hairs and cut hair only once a month.Conclusion: The bad reviews on this thing is true. I would not purchase this again or recommend anyone to buy this.
__label__2 Blood Brothers: 'Blood Brothers' is the excellent documentary showing the reunion of the E Street Band after 11 years apart and their recording of some additional tracks for Bruce's greatest hits album. Not only do I love the songs being recorded, but it is amazing to see them being performed and developed and the dynamic between all of the band members. You also get to see the music video recording for 'Murder Incorporated' which makes for a wonderful live performance and you can see just how much it means to all the fans and production crew there. This is the best place to go for an insight into Bruce when he is recording and to see how a song grows over subsequent takes and with band collaboration. This may be short, at just under 80 minutes, but it makes for riveting and inspiring viewing. Highly recommended for all fans of the boss.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
__label__1 Painfully boring.: Wow. If this CD won't put you to sleep, then you have issues. What a boring and dull CD. I, unfortunately, didn't realize that the author would start at the very, very beginning of time.. right down to atoms and protons. When the author claimed "how we went from there being nothing at all to there being something, and then how a little of that something turned into us, and also what happened in between and since", I was interested. But the CD just dragged on and on. I guess if you're into science, you'd enjoy it but I'll pass on this one.
__label__2 amazing peice of russian film: anyone who says this film is mediocre or bad just doesn't "get it". the russians have a higher standard for film than americans do, and do not mind length and "slow pace".but this film is *anything* but boring. a true story of a highly decorated soviet officer who finds himself subjected to stalin's purges. mikhalov won best international film @ cannes the year it came out. phenominal. touching. artistic at points. moving. a MUST see for any russian film lover! or anyone wanting to learn more about soviet russia.
__label__1 Do not buy this game!: Do not buy this game! The game will shutdown your PSP at random times during game play. The kicking will not showup 50% of the time during kickoffs and fieldgoals. The game also will freeze right as you cross the goalline on touchdowns and turnovers. This game should have never been released with all these bugs.
__label__2 Penguin: The real pictures in this book are great! It describes the life cycle of a penguin in easy-to-understand words.
__label__2 Crocs are great, comfy, well-priced, and wear like iron: We all wear crocs in our family. We just throw them on and out the door we go. What more can you say. This is one of the simplest versions with a good roomy fit (you'll see that some Crocs have a single digit size as in "size 8" and others have a size span as in "size 8-9") For the kids in the family we always get the ones with the size range as those tend to get the longest wear. And if you go to the Crocs website you can learn how you can recycle your used Crocs (however us adults have been wearing ours for two years already with no wear in sight)
__label__1 bad light: I don't like this light. It doesn't give enough light to play well in the daytime. The glare is very bad. You should use a lamp.
__label__1 Love the movie...just wish I could actually watch it: Short and sweet...ordered the movie. It came in cracked and when I tried to return it online there was no way I could. So I will trash the one I got on here then head on base to buy one I can actually watch and return if there are issues.
__label__1 worst product ever seen: They are guaranteeing no scratching. But my face is sore and full of bumps after using it. Completely a waste of money and I hate it. It is not at all pulling out hair but ya one thing it is absolutely doing, making my face ugly by leaving sore, red and inflamed skin.
__label__1 Worthless: There is a flanged rim on the USB side of this connector connector that would not allow it to fit into USB ports on my laptop. I tried flattening the flange and still could not make it fit...straight to the trash can and a waste of $2-3. Avoid at all costs!
__label__1 as bland as the Browns logo: It's basically a coffee table book and a not very good one at that. I wanted so much more from a franchise that has some great history. This just came across as someone's jumbled list of what they thought were the significant moments in Cleveland Browns' history.And why 338? Why not 339? 336? I don't get the decision to pick that number. narrow it down to the top 100 and you'd have a great little book.
__label__1 Not So Big House Collection: This book has many nice pictures but we did not get many usable ideas for our house project. Many suggetions are just too expensive and too custom to be practical unless you have an unlimited budget.
__label__2 Classic Clark: Here's how good this book is. I intended to just read a few chapters the other day, but ended up finishing the entire book in one night! It's a gripping well-told suspense story.The main plot revolves around Jenny, a single mother of two, who enters a whirlwind romance with Erich Kruger, an artist, and ends up moving into his home with her children. But then Erich starts become more posessive and she notices his odd fixation on his mother, who died in an accident (or was it??).Sure there was some deja vu for me in this book that made me immediately think of movies and books that have used similar plot twists (I won't say which or else it'll spoil the ending). But still this is a great book, but don't intend on putting it down once you start!
__label__1 Badly out of date: "Up to the minute".???Hardly!!March 2005, the publication date, is a loooong time ago in ipod years, if you have one of the new models, video 60 Gig for example, you will be sorely dissapointed, it talks about the nano and photo i pod as the "latest edition to the ipod family", well they are now teenagers and probably due to be retired at any moment, ipod mini anyone? Those things are Neolithic now, yet are given too much space in this "up to the minute" book as if they had just been released!Go to Borders, look thru their ipod books and find the one with your ipod in it, if you have a brand new one as at May 2006.
__label__2 great book: This book much like, the Encyclopedia of Cajun and Creole cooking, for Cajun cooking is a must have if you want authentic Hawaiian and oriental food.The book arrived in Great condition and is beautifully put together, There are no pictures but that is cool. The book has wonderful traditional recipes. It is a must have for any in home cook.It will be a valuable resource for my cooking.
__label__2 The best creme ever...: If you want a totally hydrating creme, Burt's bees is the only one to use. I am fair complexioned and my skin, as I grow older, has a tendency toward dryness. I've used all the standard brands, but none have been as beneficial as this particular creme - even those in the Burt's Bees line and many whose cost is double and even triple. I use it as a day and night creme and my skin glows after I apply it. It has a fine texture, is soft, and melts into your skin. Before I tried this particular forumla, I had a medicine chest full of useless face cremes that I used on my arms & legs after a workout. For me, Burt's Bees Beeswax Moisturizing Night Creme the best creme ever.
__label__1 Not Good For A First Read.: I found this book to be too wordy. Theorems are sometimes stated without proofs then followed by several corollaries with proof, followed finally by the proof of the original theorem. Allusions are made to geometry unfamiliar to some learning the basics of commutative ring theory. A nice book to come back to.
__label__1 Not as pictured: The product image pictured is not what you will receive, no train included this is the special edition and only has some push buttons on the front of the DVD that make some sounds.
__label__2 Rock record of the year.......: This isn't your father's Quiet Riot here. Rehab is a record short on the cheese metal that made them famous but chock full of amazing straight up rock songs. Trust me. Order this album right now and enjoy. I find it fitting that the final QR record due to the passing of Kevin Dubrow may well be the band's finest hour. Kevin's vocals and Frankie Banali's drums are flat out amazing here. I swear when I hear the drums on Rehab I feel like John Bonham is in the room. RIP Kevin and thank you for your contribution to rock music. Fly on......
__label__2 Thank you!: Thank you so much for getting this book to the other side of the world and in great condition too!
__label__2 History, Fiction and Real Life Railroad Barons: I enjoyed reading this book about James J. Hill, the Canadian that made his home in Minneapolis Saint Paul and made his fortune in Railroading. Mr. Hill, who became known as "The Empire Builder" was one of the great thinkers and builders of railroads in the 1800s. This historical fiction book combines real life events in the James Hill's amazing life and blends it into a historical novel. It's fun. I just have to share this quote of James J. Hill, a quote that I find especially poignant since I am a Swede and my grandfather was one of the ones brought over to America to make a new life, in the way of James J. Hill: "Give me snuff, whiskey and Swedes, and I will build a railroad to hell."Well, he didn't build a railroad quite that far, but he did a great deal and his railroad exists today.
__label__2 Take a chance and buy this.: I took a chance on buying this CD, as I only heard about it from a friend, and had heard no music from it. It ended up being truly one of the most worthwhile CD purchases I've made. My idea of music was so much more limited before this CD. I liked only a few of the tracks, and really didn't appreciate the grindcore tracks except for their over the top quality. But after a lot of listening it redefined music for me. It is truly refreshing and unlike anything I've heard. GREAT STEPPING STONE IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT! I highly recommend.-Chris
__label__1 Far from his best work: I ordered this book before official release date and couldn't have been more excited to get it. I have been a fan for years but this was terrible. Please, just write book 5 of the Gunslinger story. Those books were great as were most of your others.
__label__2 This is a nice toy: Hi! this is a really good toy but my kitten is beter then this so is my hamstr! well its still fun I whould buy this for your kid its fun for anybody! its really fun I bought mine at TOYS R US my tamagotchi is a baby.dont feed it to much candy or it will get sick my tamagotchis name is kitty its a girl its really cute I love it its so much fun!

I guss. I love it its fun well got to go bye!! -Julia- p.s vote for my review! (Im Jackies sister she writes a lot of polly pocket reviews please vote on hers to!)
__label__2 I return to this one often...: I first bought and read this book back in the early 90s, after reading an interview with guitarist Steve Vai in MUSICIAN magazine. This is the book that started Vai on a spiritual path, and it's been a favorite of mine as well.I've suffered from a cyclical depression for 12 years. Whenever I feel "stuck," I re-read this book.There must be something I've forgotten, I think, or why would I allow suffering to take over?Better go back and read "Magic in Your Mind" again!We can have whatever we want in this life. KNOWING and BELIEVING makes it so.
__label__2 A Fascinating Read: This is a surprisingly quick read considering how much information is in this book. Fr Amorth discusses multiple cases and reveals the many different types of evil activity that the exorcist may encounter, and how to deal with each. I found myself wishing for a lot more detail and a list of reference books. What will strike the average reader most is that all the grimness you expect in exorcism accounts, such as The Exorcist film or Malachi Martin's work, Hostage to the Devil, is largely absent. He presents the reality that the power of Jesus Christ is more than sufficient to overcome diabolic activity and protect the exorcist as well. I recommend the book wholeheartedly!
__label__2 wonderful-helps me et up in the moring.: This item is heaated in the microwave and the heat helps reduce the shoulder pain I wake up with and really starts my day. Good product and made for us older folk.
__label__2 Interesting Toy: This toy is fun for small children who want to pretend to be scientists. I ended up having to order this item directly from the manufacturer 2 days before Christmas because Amazon decided to cancel the order 2 days before Christmas for no apparent reason (stocks were available but apparently Amazon couldn't figure out how to use eHobbies website to order the item.) Since this was an item that my 4 year old had asked for from Santa, you can imagine her disappointment on Christmas day when it didn't make it under the tree.
__label__2 F.Scott without the Romance.: Appointment in Samarra is one of the most brilliant and underated novels in American Lit. This book is Heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time. O'Haras later work is spotty but this novel belongs with the classics of the era. I could not put it down and I kept thinking of Gatsby as I read this book. O'Haras short stories in his prime also bear an eerie kinship to Fitzgerald but without the idealized romantic voice.
__label__1 Hugo and Nebula awards? How?: I frankly cannot believe it won both Hugo and Nebula awards.Terribly boring with stereotypical charcters. Even the aliens whose eating, living, mating, and reproducing habits are completely different from humans, seemed to have emotional and psychological habits remarkably like humans.This is the second book I read of Asimov, and both times, I wondered what the point was to put incredibly typical and mundane characters in an extraordinary situation and make them think and say very ordinary things. Maybe it was newish back in the 70s, I don't know.But the alien life in Part 2, was enjoyable, kind of cute, and fun to read. In order to understand Part 2, you would need to go through Part 1. And if you've read until the end of Part 2, you might as well read it until the end. In that sense, it is a fairly readable book.
__label__1 I wish I could give it zero stars: I am highly disgusted with the reviews that I have read of Eton Lawrence. In no way should this individual put his talents on recording. I am a saxophonist who studies jazz at a college level. I feel insulted that people have bought this C.D., listened to it, and enjoyed it! The only thing I have gotten out of this disc is laughter. I wish Mr. Lawrence would have waited some more years and gotten control of his intonation before recording himself. It sounds like his background music was produced on Playskool's "My first keyboard"! Have any of the other reviewers heard the original version of "These are the Times" by Dru Hill? Do you know who Dru Hill is? Thats soul, which this man does not have. If you want to listen to music to get your woman hot, put in some Al Green. On the other hand, if you want to listen to a saxophonist, listen to John Coltrane or Charlie Parker!
__label__2 Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is a Detroit cop who after the murder of his friend travels to California to investigate and track down the killer, who he believes operate an arts dealership as a cover in Beverly Hills. He teams up with two reluctant detectives from the Beverly Hills police force who were supposed to keep a watch on him, especially after seeing Foley's different approach to tackling the situations which is not acceptable by the chief of the local police. This movie has the combination of clever comedy and the ingredients from harder action thrillers that ensured Beverly Hills Cop status as a cop comedy classic.
__label__1 Terrible: I'm a huge horror buff and thought this was going to be a lot of fun. Oh my lord, THIS IS B-A-D. If you want to "choose your own adventure go elsewhere. It's the same thing over and over, and the questions are the same over and over. The story is terrible. The lead actor is terrible. You are better off buying a DVD that is a real campy horror movie. I could go on for days, but you should be shopping elsewhere.
__label__1 motorola china junk: Can't beleive the Motorola garbage from China. Purchased 2 of the headsets maybe lasted an hour each. Also purchased a s9 headset got3 hours out of that. Chinese products are falling apart.
__label__2 Dark western: This is a western a bit off the beaten trail. It's almost a bit film noir with its flawed hero and tension filled plot. While there is action in it, it is more about the delicate balance with in the criminal gang thrown into chaos by the return of Link (Gary Cooper). It is a well told story, well worth seeing!
__label__2 Great 3-Piece System: This is a fantastic 3-Piece Computer Speaker System. The title says 2-Piece, but it is wrong. These things crank pretty nicely and for the money I don't know how you beat them. The only thing I would do is weigh them down a bit as they are so light that operating the controls on the right side speaker might cause the unit to move a bit.Easy hook up, great sound and a low price make these speakers a great addition if you are looking for 2.1 channel performance.
__label__2 They are supreme...: I think this CD is for anybody with an open mind. The music is flowy and has fast beats at times. 'Never the Same' is a perfect opening song for the album because of the sliding backround melody and creative lyrics. The fastest song,'StrangeLove Addiction', starts out slow for a few seconds, but then turns into good beats and rhythms to dance to. 'Ain't Got Nothin'' is at first slow, then speeds up, then slow, and goes on like this. But it is a very good song and the shifts make it possible because it actually complements the lyrics sung with it. 'Under the Gun's' intro sounds similiar to the beginning of a James Bond movie and it makes the song a perfect ending to a perfect album. Overall, this CD is excellent for on the go or to relax and calm down. All the tracks are great, because as soon as one good song finishes, there's another right after. This CD is perfect to own because it won't leave you begging for more because you found it all in one place.
__label__2 Worth every penny...: This is a great litter box I have in the corner of my computer room. It is rather large but what do u expect for a litterbox that has built in stairs? The stairs have cut down on the amount of litter tracking signifigantly and I don't smell the litterbox all the time like I used to. A very great buy for our home & kitty, indeed!
__label__1 Although informative, quite boring and tedious to read: This book was a requirement for my 11th grade gifted and talented english program. Alhtough this book was quite informative, my classmates and I often found ourselves dozing off at home while completing the necessary reading. The book gave good background on the reasons behind the mass migration of the Puritans to New England, but if you don't have to read this book, I suggest you don't!
__label__1 Do Not Buy This: I had been told that conures just loved this thing, so I bought one for my Sun Conure and she did indeed love it. That is until today when we found her hanging from it by a thread wrapped around her neck. She was so scared and was wildly flapping her wings. My husband managed to cut the thread and set her free before any damage was done to her, but I would not ever put one back in her cage again.
__label__2 One Chance is fantastic.: All 10 tracks are very good but there are four or five that are superb.I have listened to this CD over and over. It's the perfect CD have in your car.I hope Paul tours the US and to record a 2nd CD by Christmas.Come to YouTube and chat about Paul.EddieInVirginia
__label__1 waste of money: I don't mind a bad movie now and then, this movie was one of the worst movies in syfy history.I rate this movie "-5 stars". Don't waste 90 minutes of your time on this tripe.
__label__2 Best show on tv!!: If you like suspense and drama, this show is an excellent choice! It constantly delivers nothing but the best plot twists, storylines, action, and suspense. It is one of the few shows that can actually keep me on the edge of my seat..and constantly keeps me guessing. The format and filmography are approached from a fresh, new angle. I definitely recommend seeing this!
__label__1 UGH: It has been said that sometimes stupid is funny, sometimes it isn't. This is a movie where it isn't. Avoid at all costs.
__label__1 Giving the Fugees a bad name!: I recently spent my hard earned cash on the canibus cd and it was a waste of money. His harsh voice does not match his appearence and none of the beats really caught my ear.
__label__1 Would have been a cool game expect.: Start, play for five minutes, then CRASH. Norton SystemWorks couldn't handle those. I hope they have patches soon.
__label__2 Max Payne.... Max Fun!: I am very picky when it comes to games. Ecspecially when you have a shoot-em up game because they tend to have little or no story (IE Quake 3). In my opinion a story makes the game by far. This game EASILY makes my grade. Like one reviewer wrote, this game has AWESOME graphics, AMAZING gameplay, and of course; a non-improvable story. Never before have I ever played a game with a plot more intriguing and yet the graphics and action make it even better. The Slowtime feature (enables you to be in slo-mo matrix style) NEVER gets old and is very useful for the game. Max's voice is a bit too much, very low and very deep, often times amusing. PARENTS WARNING: While this game IS fun it is also VERY violent I would not reccomend the game for people under 11 or so.Overall, this game is shaping up to be the action game of the year, if not overall best game of the year. Thinking about getting it? GET IT its totally worth it. TRUST ME.
__label__1 The worst book about singing out there: I have read so many books about singing, you would think I'm crazy.This was the worst one, because it doesn't tell you anything. It just keeps saying how wonderfull her method is, so if you want come fly over please!
__label__1 This Fruity Knucklehead Belongs in a Padded Room: There's a striking similarity between this oddball and more mainstream oddballs like Jim Cramer, but I can't quite put my finger on it....
__label__1 Don't waste your money.: I read the mixed reviews on this product and hoped for the best. I have been a long time fan if linksys because everything I have ever gotten from them worked very well for me, for what I need it for. I thought that this camera would help with security and would be fun to watch the cats and the house from work. I was really excited. Well the camera showed up, and it was very attractive, and very easy to set up. I didn't like that it only used WEP and not WPA, but I could have lived with that. The major problem that I had with it, and the major complaint is that the picture qualty is terrible... This is not a 140 dollar camera. I didn't have it out for 5 hours before I printed out my return label. Look at Axis lan cameras. A little more expensive but you can view their cams on the web and see what you are getting. Hope this helps you save some time and money.
__label__2 I loved this on IFC - that's why I bought the DVD series: This is a great series - A very updated spin on the old MTM show - Unfortunately the 3rd season became a victim of the writer's strike and the series was not renewed.
__label__2 Not another sound bite: This is a film that needs to be absorbed in its entirety to be fully enjoyed. The music and images blend together to create a mood and sets the film into motion. In our sound bite society most of us can't tolerate waiting 15 minutes to begin understanding a film...but if you are there are hidden treasures in the world.
__label__1 I Was So Disappointed: At 60 yrs old, I'm just beginning to experiment with different types of bars that are a healthier choice. I learned several good lessons when ordering the Luna Bars. Not all tastebuds are equal!! To me they had the strangest taste of any bar I've tried. To make matters worse, the order got doubled somehow, but I didn't have the heart to send them back since it was my fault. I will take more time to read ALL of the best reviews. I often do this to prevent the kind of problem that happened. I'd have to look and see what I paid for them, but if anyone is interested, I'd make you a deal on a box of these Luna Bars. Sorry Luna, you've got a long way to go!!
__label__2 Magic of Change - Your Personal, Business & Spiritual Lives: This book covered so many more areas of my life than I was expecting. The chapters are each very short and easy to read either one at a time or straight through.What suprised me the most was how their ideas and suggestions could be used in all areas of my life - personal, business and spiritual. The book shows you entirely different ways to approach changes which all of us must encounter in life. One example of this that I particularly liked was "When disasters strike, we can either get bitter or get better - the secret, of course, is attitude."They also give a lot of valuable information for management to use in the workplace which they have proven tried and true with the details included.I highly recommend this book to everyone. It will provide many important strategies for you to use in every aspect of your life.
__label__2 Very natural: This is a great product for those days when you feel a bit anxious or on-edge. I tend to use two tablets during PMS, but it's good for a more balanced, calmer mood and feel. Very natural and non-habit forming.
__label__1 Lousy!: Circulon is great in the beginning, but it does NOT last. I bought this set (or one very similar to it) ten years ago, have not used most of it very much, and have taken proper care of it (only plastic or wooden implements used and never put in the dishwasher). Virtually everything that I have used regularly needs to be replaced. The hard anodized surface wears off, and food begins sticking to it. The grooves are very difficult to clean, because food gets stuck in between them. I am in the process of replacing all of it with Caphalon Commercial Non-Stick, whose incredibly smooth surface cooks like a dream. It costs a little bit more, but maybe ten years from now, it won't have to be replaced.
__label__1 Not worth it: I just recently unpacked and began assembling this item. It is of unacceptable quality. The castings are especially poor. I had to file and sand them just to be able to assemble the product. The fence is not straight. The hollow chisel I tried first is so soft that the set screw used to hold it in puts a dent in the chisel.I knew this unit was made in Asia, but I thought Delta would hava a little better quality control. I bought mine just before Christmas and didn't see John's review but I am with him and am returning the unit. I intend to buy a mortiser but this one is inferior! Thanks
__label__2 Riveting drama: Mitch Grobeson was the first openly gay officer with the Los Angeles Police Department and was eventually harrassed off the force. In this fictional work, Grobeson skillfully combines imaginary characters with real-life past experiences to weave a compelling story of indiscriminate torture-killings of LA street hustlers and the LAPD's refusal to pursue the killer. Grobeson is not a professional novelist, but he manages to intertwine many of his experiences as an LAPD officer with fiction to create a book that one hesitates to put down.
__label__2 KERASIOTES MUST GO: Dr. Bananamore endured a traffic nightmare when he last visited Boston. And Quincy Market doesn't even have any good oddball stores anymore. Where did the pig store go? It's all just a bunch of expensive fashion retailers. Not even a Cuthbert's, Inc. Scrod Bananamore left the city entirely due to its inhospitality. Be gone, Kerasiotes. Haven't you done enough already?
__label__1 sadly disappointed: To whom it may concern:At least once a week our family has a taco night. Out of about every box of 12 shells, only about 2 are suitable for tacos, rest fit for nachos, due to breakage. Is there not a better way to package these shells? Thank you,Joan Mitchell
__label__1 The drag of all times: I came to this Opera through sort of a back door. I was watching a documentary on Maria Callas. And several times he mentioned that she played Norma. Somehow I had overlooked this Opera so I thought I would catch up. This was the only version that was readily available I thought Norma is Norma is Norma.I can see now that I made a small mistake. In general I don't like things that are in modern dress. But again I thought normal is Norma was Norma. I waited for them speak when they did I sort of wish they didn't. I have to confess I was using English subtitles. The production never got any better. It just drag on and on and on.One day I hope to look at a different version and see what it is that Norma that makes it a classic as this version was the drag of all times.
__label__1 stupid: The problem with standard deviants is that they talk down to the viewer, and constantly make stupid jokes. These are made for little kids or something.I wanted some real substance, but most of the video is full of stupid antics.
__label__2 Incredible: Pick this album up at all costs. One of the Best albums of 2003. Although it isn't as good as Aenema or Lateralus (both works of pure genius), this is a big step beyond mer de noms. More atmospheric and melodic than Tool (but not as heavy). The Outsider, gravity, noose, weak and powerless, pet, blue are especially good. If 3 Libras was your favorite song on Mer de Noms, you will LOVE this album. If your favorite song was more in the 'Judith' vein, you still have hard tracks like pet and the outsider to keep you happy. 5 stars.
__label__2 Excellent: This is an excellent feild manual for identifying edible and medicinal plants. Very extensive information on all plants in the eastern United States. With this manual i'll never ever go hungry.
__label__2 Absolutely worth reading.: I loved this book. My family and I want to move to Alaska and this book only made us want want to more. Hilarious and true to life accounts of living up north.
__label__2 Super cool device: I use this with my Blackberry Curve. The play/pause/volume and skip controls make listening to my music a breeze and the sound quality is pretty good. Occasionally the sound drops out for a half-second or so, and the controls take a while to get used to.
__label__2 just what I expected: Was not difficult to install , Great for small kids and adults we fit lol . what more could you ask for the price .
__label__2 Superb!: This is absolutely the best FPS I have ever played! It's got excellent gameplay which almost makes it feel more like an RPG than a FPS. The graphics are not quite up to par considering it uses the Unreal engine from a couple of years ago, but the graphics are still great. The sound is fabulous. The storyline is about as well put together as a storyline gets.I recommend this game to any gamer of any genre. The level editor is also the most fun thing I've ever used. Once you get used to it you get really hooked. It's also the best game you can buy for that price. Deus Ex is definately the best game. If you don't have it yet then pick it up now.
__label__2 Excellent: Something different from the usual fare on cable. An unusual insite into a bygone era so closely intwined with the US in history.
__label__2 Instant Improvement from Standard AV Cables: As soon as I plugged in the HD link for Wii to my HDTV, the latency went away and the graphics quality increased a noticeable amount! I play a lot of online multiplayer games (Call of Duty) so latency was a huge problem with the standard AV cables that come with the Wii. I highly recommend this product!
__label__1 Not good vitamin: Not good product, stomach problem and headache. I wouldn't recommend it. The low price does not give a good sign that this is a quality product.
__label__1 a rental: gotta wonder what the heck pooh was thinking. the wash is a bad movie - and i don't mean bad in good way, i'm talking bad in an extremely terrible way. trying to remember a funny part, and can only come up with one - which involves snoop and tommy chong (cheech and chong). would have given less than 1 star - but the scale doesn't allow a lower rating than 1. if you must view it, break out your video rental card, pick up some no doze and coffee, maybe put on a pair of sneakers two sizes too small, and you might be able to stay awake through it.
__label__2 Fresh insight and observation: I am re-reading "Buck Naked Faith" now, and I am just as engaged as the first time. I find myself saying, "Yeah, that's right" or "Humph" often because Sandras crystallizes age old (and new) spiritual insight on subjects often thought about by many.I recommend this book for just about any person over the age of about thirteen or fourteen. There are some adult situations discussed, but nothing gratuitous.You will be challenged when you read this book.
__label__1 Temperamental: This hand mixer only works when it wants to. Very disappointing. Sometimes it will turn on, sometimes it will not. If I smack the battery compartment hard enough, the mixer will work again.Not a good toy.
__label__2 Definitely A Must See: One of the best action films I seen Ben Affleck in. He's phenomenial in this movie. Straight bad ass from start to finish. It's way better than his leading role in Dare Devil.
__label__2 Wonderful!: My 6 year old recieved this book for Christmas at the age of 5 and she still loves it. The pictures are colorful and there is enough detail to keep her attention, but they are not cluttered. There are only 12 mazes in the book, but she loves to go back through the mazes, look at the pictures again and again, even though she knows them by heart. I do think though that a young child does need to have a good attention span to sit and do these mazes, it is not appropriate for all children of 5 or 6. It is rated for children at the age of 9.
__label__1 THE EGYPTIAN: Too much black space above and below picture, Asian script at bottom was distracting. After 15 minutes gave up on watching the movie until I found something to block my view of the Asian script. Regretable purchase.
__label__1 Bottom of the barrel: I've owned three jump drives, and this one was by far the worst. It has firmware that you have to work around, and computers often wouldn't recognize this unit, which at one point prevented me from saving valuable data. (I used it on four different PCs, with about a 50% success rate.)Getting the cap aligned just right was a nuisance.I'm very delighted, though, with another Lexar product with the same memory and in the same price range. Go for the newer model.
__label__1 brushguard: ordered a go rhino 3000 brush guard. started with step 1 and no holes drilled for brackets, re ordered piece, took two weeks to get and i will be damned 2nd piece still no holes. also missing screws and nuts in package. companies quality control sucks!!!!!
__label__1 Terrible.: Have played all the other major RPG's. Never played the first installment of this game, but purchased it due to the great reviews. Wish I had never read them. The game is terribly tedious to play and crashes every 15 minutes. Have tried for a week to get into it without success. The game has now been uninstalled and is going on ebay to get a small amount of money back out of this mistake of a purchase.
__label__2 fun flag: it is a simple flag, but not too thick or strong of material. good for hanging up or putting in a place where it won't be exposed to the elements. nice for the price!
__label__1 Worthless: This is a worthless lawn tool. No matter how light of job you have (perfectly dried leaves dropped in one at a time)it can't handle it. I sold mine at a garage sell for $5 and felt guilty for sticky someone with a worthless product. DON"T BUY!
__label__1 A Clear and Present Danger: I thought I had seen it all. I have read some of the most passionate of diatribes from those left-of-center bashing the very capitalist society in which they thrive, but this lady takes the cake. It is laughable at best for ANYONE with half of a fraction of a decimal of a single I.Q. point to take this woman seriously. Why, you ask? It is very simple. Ask the author how much money is she making from this book. Then ask her how much she is sending to the poor and the downtrodden she embraces in her "journal of woes". Once again, another liberal (sorry to lay that label down on some of you...I would run like the wind!) biting the very hand that is feeding them. Avoid this book, unless you run out of Charmin.
__label__2 Chairr is great for extensive homeuse: I can't complain about this chair. It gets a lot of use. My teen sons roll back and forth on this and it's holding up well. With all the usage it sometimes come undone but you can just tighten back up. Great deal for the price.
__label__2 Great Love story with a wonderful setting.: Dana Hamilton finds herself the target of someone who wants her to leave Hawaii. That person seems to know the secret she shares with her sister about something that happened years and years ago. Rob is the tenatious reporter who insists on helping Dana get to the bottom of the mystery. She's drawn to him,yet cannot get over the troubles in his past--until the villain resorts to murder. All of this is set against a tropical backdrop of Hawaii. Smoothly interwoven is history and culture, which makes for a "bigger" book with all the hallmarks of a true classic. The villain--as in all Meryl's books--comes as a surprise to the reader. This is a book you won't want to miss.
__label__1 Gorgeous but Leaky: Third replacement for the Kohler Forte. It leaks between the bottom of the faucet and the base, so no amount of plumber's putty works. Customer service claims it's O rings. It is not. They have been replaced. I won't buy Kohler again due to issues with my Forte, which ironically means "strong" in German.
__label__1 Slowww...: I have the 128M version of this card. It does not work at all in my high-end digital camera. The card must be the slowest, oldest technology on the market....I finally just through it away.
__label__2 Two phones on one line: This has been a godsend for this wheelchair-bound person; I don't have to drive out to the kitchen from my office to pick up our home phone. (The fact that most of those calls are from political hacks I don't want to talk to is another story, of course....) I put the second handset by my computer and grab it whenever our home phone rings. I was brokenhearted when the second handset broke and immediately went online to Amazon to buy a replacement.
__label__1 The Truth: Anything by Bill O'Reilly is an automatic piece of garbage. He isn't capable of writing (?) anything else. He is too self-centered to actually focus an another subject to produce a book.
__label__1 Not much depth: This book was a real disappointment. I never felt as though I really got to know the characters, but considering how cruel they were to each other, that's probably just as well. The only thing on these characters' minds was getting into bed with each other. I would have liked to have seen more detail about their jobs, which would have made the story more interesting. I bought the book because I knew that Ria was an architect and that sounded interesting. I thought that Taylor was particularly insensitive to Ria throughout most of the book, and Ria seemed to say things to Taylor that always made him angry, with good reason. If you're looking for a book with depth, this isn't it.
__label__1 Only for the NYC Fashion Crowd: I love Fashion and love the City so hearing about the designer clothes and the descriptions of living in NYC were great but other than that the book seemed a little weak for all of the hype surrounding it.
__label__1 Sensitive Skin Sizzler: I REALLY wanted to like this lotion BUT, it pains me to use it. Literally. The tingle in it was very umm....hardcore. If tingle doesn't bother you then it might be a great product. Instead of this, I now use dangerously dark (also by swedish beauty) and cannot be more pleased.
__label__2 RDH Review: Very good collection of songs featuring some great blues harp.A must for anyone interested in the history and development of this genre.
__label__2 I am famous: In the two weeks since i bought and read this bible, I have become a celebrity superstar. see me this fall as creator/writer/star of Fill Me Up. A new comedy about the price of gas in the U.S.
__label__2 Excellent telling of history we need to know: The DRC is an enormous country with an abundance of natural resources. This intriguing history of the exploitation and abuse by one single man and the reprecussions still felt today are well worth the read. Very well written Something to keep in your personal library.
__label__2 great book...good insight: This book had a greater influence on my college process than any other book on the market. The author is candid, clever and right on target. The book is also an easy and enjoyable read, fun for all those in, out of, and interested in the chaotic process that is modern admissions. Two thumbs up.
__label__2 Good quality: These covers have survived 4-5 Boston winters outdoors and while the colors might have faded somewhat are still in use today and doing their job. Recommended product.
__label__1 weak: Had this machine for 6 months and hate it. Loud and annoying. Very buggy and difficult overall to manage Waste of money. Next time I'll read these reviews.
__label__1 Not worth the price: I use it with a Cross Gel rolling ball (0.7mm) refill. Have used the pen for about 3 months. Didn't find ink quality/flow as smooth as a Pilot G2-7 gel ink pens. Cap caused scratches to develop on the the top of outer barrel as well as the black portion of the barrel where one typically holds the pen to write.The blue/chrome combination looks good; but not worth the price given the flimisiness of the finish and quality/flow of ink compared to other (much less expensive) pens.
__label__1 Glory, Glory: I like Linda Lael Miller's stories, but it seems that with each book she writes, her descriptions become more pronographic. I don't need, or want, to know the in depth details of every sex act in the book. She's gone too far....she'd be better off leaving something to the imagination!
__label__2 Brilliant!: "Mission to Mars" sets the bar for science fiction movies to an all-time high! From the opening party sequence to the non lift-off sequence to Mars. Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise) is in top form leading his squad of astronauts on a mission to find life on Mars. Even though the year is 2020, the movie feels like a 1950's B-movie. The movie is pure intellect! The squad (Connie Nielsen, Jerry O'Connell, Tim Robbins and the MIA Don Cheadle). A strange face was formed in the sand and water was found on Mars! The explanation for the human species was dumbfounding! What an extravagant piece of filmmaking! Brian De Palma tries to pull a Stanley Kubrick and does better! The CGI is breathtaking, watch the aliens transform into dinosaurs and then people! What an impressive, captivating, enthralling motion picture! Everybody needs to experience this masterpiece!
__label__1 large vocabulary, but poorly written: I bought this book because I am a German student, and I thought that this book would be the best. However, there is a major problem. In the English to German section, no plurals of any nouns are given. You must look the word up again in the German to English section to find the plurals. This is a huge inconvenience, and I am sorry I bought the book.
__label__2 Great, even for hardcore Bikram classes: I've had this mat for a long time and abused it allot through my years of sweaty Bikram classes, doesn't slip at all, top quality, the only thing that fell off (which is the only thing that can) is the logo, but that's not my problem :-) Don't go for the cheap foam ones, they start smelling bad and will fall apart, this mat can be cleaned with some diluted tea tree oil and smells great again and looks like new. The only thing that might bother some folks is, that it is fairly firm, compared to the foam ones anyways. But for balance, firmness is preferred, at least for me. Namaste
__label__2 The BEST EVER----: This is the best computer game I have ever played.The best the best the best.I owned Medal of Honor Allied Assault, Sum of all Fears, Ghost Recon, and the various rainbow six games but I got rid of ALL of them.With Return to Castle Wolfenstein I dont need to play any other games. This...rocks yo!!!
__label__2 The producers stayed true to the feeling of the original story: This was a lovely movie. It was not completely true to the book but stayed true to the main idea and magical feeling of the book. Unlike the Borrowers movie done in the US. Very well made and it motivated me to read the whole series again. Wonderful for children.
__label__2 A must for detective fans: Gloriously arch and polished performance from Ms Rigg as an amateur lady detective (complete with chauffeur) in an English countryhouse murder set in the 1920s. If you like the almost cosy but always complete evocation of time and place in the Poirot and Miss Marple series then this is for you. (Although you may find the pop psychology that crops up in the script a touch jarring and even anachrononistic, it's not the scriptwriters' fault - it's a feature of the original novels).
__label__2 D-Day, The Climactic Battle of World War II: For anyone interested in getting real insight as to what it took to successfully invade France during WW2, this is the book. Ambrose takes all necessary attention to explaining the massive preparation that made invasion possible. While he misses none of the political and logistical points, he also manages to bring the reader on board the Higgens boats, C-17s, and gliders. The tension of those moments fills the reader. Ambrose never loses the notion that each man who fell had a life and wanted to keep it. A wonderful book. I have given four copies to friends as gifts. Three never before read historical non-fiction. All four have continued on to buy other books by this gifted writer.
__label__1 A practically useless software: Spamkiller downloaded all my e-mails from the mail server and checked the title and text of the messages for spams. This frequent process took up lot of time and it caught less than 1 percent of the spams. The update center was really annoying. I didn't pay much for the software, but it wasted my time and system time. The software was deinstalled after two weeks. I ended up using a free software 'mailwasher'. Mailwasher didn't catch most of the spams either, but it only downloaded the titles. I checked which are spams, which I need to read. The program deleted the spams on the mail server directly. The solution is not prefect but it helps. McAfee Spamkiller did nothing execept wasting time and resouces.
__label__2 awesome, awesome, awesome: This album is OUTSTANDING. I've been playing it for everyone I know and they're equally impressed. Joan Osborne has a voice that is just...fabulous! Clearly, she's one of the greats.Her cover of "War" is the highlight, in my opinion. The subject of the song really is captured magnificently the way she slows the song down - it's pure genius. "Everybody Is A Star" is so simple and subtle yet so powerful. "How Sweet It Is" is radically different and such a revelation. The emotion and sensuality is easily felt. "Think" has more meaning than ever!I can't say enough! The album is true art, a true success!!
__label__1 the worst product ever: This product does not work. mechanism to take the diaper from top into the waste basket is terrible and does not work. A complete waste of money.
__label__1 No temp scale: Very poor way of attaching the temp scale on the dial. Can't ever tell what temp that is being used. Can't recommend this item.
__label__2 Wonderful!!: I bought this tent for my 16 month old for Christmas. We were so excited when it arrived that we put it together early! We bought it for $24 and I think we're definitely getting our money's worth! Very durable, perfect size! He likes to put a chair in it and watch movies!
__label__2 Business trivia: The authors deliver as promised through a blitzkrieg tour of '100 Great Businesses'. At times the information is scarce and superficial, but if you're looking for business trivia, or a quick glimpse for areas worth further research, this is a great book for the task.
__label__1 Excessive and poorly executed: I am not the squeamish sort, but I thought this film was excessively violent, and at times poorly acted. Yeah sure it is a movie about war and ethnic cleansing. Still, there are better ways to make a point than by using the level of violence used in this movie. The worst performance by far is by Stellan Skarsgard, who even does the whole cliched reaching out the hand and screaming "Nooo!". That was.....laughable. The best performances were by the native Serbian actors, not by Dennis Quaid, who I usually like. Politically motivated movies are fine, but they can be done more artistically, with better results. If you feel there are better ways of depicting war atrocity than by watching pregnant women get kicked in the stomach, and watching latex hands lose digits, watch something else. I will be I assure you.
__label__1 This review is for the R-Rated version: Wicked Sister is an interesting movie starring two half sisters Chelsea and Misty Mundae. Misty plays the bad sister who gets her good sister Chelsea into some bad trouble at school and now they're on the lam. Along the way the meet a crazy woman who wants to play a game with the two. An entertaining movie that is hampered by heavy editing.It's okay, but get the unrated one instead.
__label__2 The Best Marriage Book for Your Money: I have read over 15 marriage and relationship books, and this one gets it right. It is the most honest, frank and in-depth look at marriage you can find without going to a professional therapist level.I have to warn you that some of the language is rough, and he has no conpunctions about being explicit. No, he's not a pervert. He talks about sex and marriage the way that it is and some times that isn't "nice".
__label__1 DON NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT: The buttons, especially the + button works only if you press it firmly with a pause and slow. So if you like to work fast with your fingers, then forget about this piece of technological failure. It is so frustrating to have to restart your long computation half way because the buttons malfunction. I threw this piece of junk out of the window.
__label__2 It DOES work!!!: I had suffered from recurrent UTIs for a long time due to immunosuppression medications I have to take for organ transplant. Antibiotics were the ONLY cure. Cranberry-containing supplements did not work. I have not had a single episode of UTI since I began taking this product. Unbelievable!!! I just want to say THANK YOU to those who worked on development of this remedy. IT WORKS!!!
__label__2 Significantly better than others: I read this book and also "A practical introduction to data structures and algorithims" by Schaffer. Weiss' was much clearer; the code was cleaner and less confusing.
__label__2 Unique & Timeless: Unparalled and timeless arrangements! Hypnotic and rhythmic flamenco guitar music. This CD sets the ambience for laid back entertaining and relaxing. I had to stop loaning La Esperanza because it never was returned. La Esperanza is one of my favorite CDs, especially when listening to music to relax. Gypsy Flame by Armik and Seduction by Oscar Lopez are in the same genre. You will enjoy listening to both.
__label__1 Totally ignored: 600 TH bed sheets - I responded TWICE with the vendor when they erroneously put my request as KING instead of QUEEN. I gave the sheets away, and will not do business with them again. They had plenty of time to rectify this situation, since I made sure they knew King was the wrong size before they shipped and still ignored my request.
__label__1 Not interested in this toy!: My 3 year old and 7 year old tried this out the first day, but then it just became this thing I trip over! It is not that exciting for them! Look for a more challenging one or one that you have to do something like move a ball or something I thought I saw one like that.
__label__1 Great movie- poor product: I rented the movie to watch the end as despite the lack of scratches on the DVD, the movie stops at a point and cannot be read by any new or used DVD Player. The product was made faulty and unfortunately by the time I had the time to watch BSG, and try it on other DVD players it was too late to return the BSG DVD.
__label__2 What RPGs were always meant to be!: Near perfection. It's actually hard to say how good Skies of Arcadia is, but here's my advice: if you like RPGs and have a Dreamcast, then you MUST buy this game!!! (and Shenmue too)
__label__2 an unabashed SCOTS fan....: This was my fifth SCOTS CD and I am very pleased. Imaginative, silly, incredible musicianship....all around very entertaining, fun, and pleasing! Thanks SCOTS - you make me smile when I hear your music!
__label__1 slippery: The chain saw is okay but, when you try to hold it with gloves, it can slip out of your left hand, which could make it a very serious situation. I have tried to figure out a solution to make the left handle less slippery but to this date haven't come up with a good one. I almost returned it because of that.
__label__1 useless piece of crap: the plastic cage meant to prevent breakage quickly broke.the heater never heated well then died completely in a couple months.you'd be better off lighting your farts to warm the tank up.
__label__1 Terrible: This book starts of interesting however the book goes on and on and on about scenarios involving people over the phone,it rarely mentions person to person or online scams.The book suggested solutions to preventing social engineering attacks is really poor,I enjoyed the book for a few days but its really same old all the way through,many of the stories read like Hack Philes you can find on the net,full of lies and waffle.You will find your self bored of the book,there are plenty of copies of it on e-bay for a reason,buy it for sentiment only and because its black.I can't believe its by Mitnick
__label__2 Seriously,What the Heck ARE You talking about?: Me and Hannah don`t know what you are talking about!Me and Chelsea Churro would`nt hurt a fly,(Well,actually,I WOULD hurt a fly )we just stand up for what is right.LGP3LNCEVERYTHING LUVERFOREVERIN ALL ETERNITYROCK SQUARED
__label__1 Here comes the Bride: This is not a review but a request. Can anyone tell me what the words are to Here comes the Bride? I need them for my wedding. Please help
__label__2 Chemical free cleaning: I love my steam mop. I have pets and people on my floor so I really don't like the idea of harsh chemicals remaining in my household's environment. Additionally, I do not like the idea of more chemicals being poured into the local river. However, because I have pets, I need to kill germs in my house. With the steam mop, I know my floors are truly clean without. The pads are easy to change and easy to wash.
__label__1 Point missed: The magic behind the original Japanese Gojira series of movies is the corniness of the plot as well as the cheekiness of the special effects. Just as the "Batman" movie completely lost the "comic book" feel of the original series, this movie loses the entire sense of the character and allows the "plot" to deteriorate into nothing more than a "shoot 'em up- blow 'em up" movie with a lot of gratuitous violence toward an animal whose only crime is the fact that it is behaving like an animal. I literally threw this in the trash 3/4 of the way through the movie.
__label__2 A very good product: I actually eventually discarded the international adapters because I never travel outside the US. It was so reasonable I just use it as an extra charger.
__label__1 Recognizes my voice, but not what I'm saying: I've had this headset for about 9 months. The only reason it has taken me this long to replace it is a lack of money. It has been driving me crazy the whole 9 months. Here's why:1. To connect to my phone via the bluetooth I have to turn it on then turn it off, then turn it on again. Sometimes I have to repeat this two or three times. (It's not the phone. I've checked.)2. When I voice dial sometimes it doesn't transmit what I say correctly. Ex: I say "work" to call my office. It confirms "Brian" and calls my friend. (Again, not the phone. I've checked.)3. It's so loose on my ear that I have to hold it tight to my head so I can hear. So much for hands free. And I often have to cup my hand over the microphone and my mouth so I can be heard. I might as well hold the phone!Really don't bother getting this one. It's a waste of money.
__label__2 it's ok.....: My 2.5 yr old loves thomas, he has great hand eye coordination, so i thought we would try this game, even if his 4.5 yr old sister had to help. Ok so the game graphics are definately rough, and so are the voices. Both kids were very frustrated along with me on the lack of control in turning thomas down different tracks. as you are "driving" thomas a small screen in the corner shows a map with blinking lights of where you need to go next (along with an arrow) but getting thomas to turn is not easy. other than that it cute, and a pretty easy concept for the game. and well it's thomas!! so my son is happy.
__label__1 Sound quality disappointing: I have very small ears and have found it impossible to exercise with the apple earbuds. These are really comfortable but unfortunately the sound quality is tinny and lacks good bass. But what good is a nice fitting earbud if the sound is bad.
__label__2 A good buy!: I'm a teacher, and bought this for use with behavior management in my classroom. Large, clear display, easy to use buttons, and the ability to record lap times. Minus 1 star for the buttons not beeping when pressed. I like the kids to hear when I've started timing them. I guess they'll just have to watch me press the buttons instead!
__label__2 Dice, nothing more: Everyone gives it a bad reveiw, if they were not satisfied they should have read the info., it planly states that they do not match, and that there not the best. BUT THERE CHEAP! DUH!
__label__2 I love it!!: This product was exactly what I was looking for. It takes some time to assemble, but the quality is very nice and it is very sturdy. The pegs allow you to customize where you want the shelves. It fits perfectly on the floor under the window and the top makes a nice shelf to hold more craft items. I'm very satisfied with the unit and would buy another.
__label__2 Most Frightening Movie Ever: The Exorcist is by far the most frightening film ever made - nothing else even comes remotely close. Those who say that the film was "boring" or "almost funny" must be in some kind of fear-induced denial. I remember when I first saw the film back in early 1974, I was 16 years old and I couldn't sleep for weeks. I remember laying in bed watching TV in those days after seeing the film, and when a TV commercial for the movie would come on, I would close my eyes and cover my ears until the commercial was over. The film preys upon human beings' most basic and fundemental fears.
__label__1 ready to rumble: Ready to Rumble is the dumbest act of uncivilized humor since Dumb and Dumber. It's alright but I wouldn't buy it I'd record it. The plot is 2 Jimmy the King fans go crosscountry to find him that's about it. I'm done so buy.
__label__2 No candy coating here!: Seems like people either love this book or hate it--I loved it. It is sad that a church can become such a snakepit that the members are actually poisoned. This book takes us inside and shows us what happened. Not candy coated or pretty, but it all rings true.
__label__1 Cell - and unfinished novel: I've been a King fan for many years. This book was great ..... until you got to the end. It just leaves you hanging, never finding out what actually happened. It just stopped .... NOT ended .... just stopped! Save your money!!!!!
__label__2 Pretty Good Work For A Teen-Ager: Frankenstein is a little book that is a very creditable effort for a nineteen-year-old author to have written. It is not a masterpiece, per se, and it bears almost no relation to the famous Universal films. The style is very 19th century, with florid prose, melodrama, and epistles, but it isn't boring (nor is it particularly scary). You'll be better off having read it than not, however, and it'll take a day at most.
__label__2 A step above Cussler!: I read with interest the reviewer who dissed this book and couldn't disagree more. As a once Cussler fan I got bored with the sameness and the venture off into the Sci-fi arena. Ted Bell does it a little better and it remains to be seen if he continues on this path. Loved the twins, the jaunt to Germany, and tie in with WW II. Also found the French-Chinese connection viable and the Bonaparte character a hoot. Keep it up Ted, you have a fan here!
__label__1 Great mouse... horrible with interference.: Sadly this mouse (at least the release I have) is horrible at interference. (My version came with the MX 5000 keyboard.)I had constant lag issues and could not figure out what was going on. I tried updating the software, I tried using it without the software, I tried using the Windows bluetooth and then Logitech's software for that. Nothing I did worked, until I moved my computer into a different room from my wireless router.What Logitech doesn't tell you is that wifi devices and other wireless mice interfere with this mouse HORRIBLY. I don't know if a different Bluetooth adapter would fix the issue, but out of the box, the adapter it came with, this mouse does not function well.When you get it in a room with no interference, it works GREAT! 5 star worthy.I purchased an MX620 and it's updated adapter has no interference issues. I'm currently waiting for my MX1100 to come in the mail so I can compare it to that.
__label__1 Expected Better: Not really impressed with the litter pan. I mean, shipping was prompt and even showed up earlier, and it was well packaged. I later on read the "Colors Vary" part (I know, hard to miss), and when I got it, I was expecting green. At least you should have a color select if that's the case. Now I'm stuck with a litter pan that my ferret seems to hate and the color just sticks out. The product is also quite small. This is probably my first Amazon bad experience.
__label__2 airborn audio= m sayyid and high priest: After spending the past two years in the lab, High Priest and M Sayyid of Anti Pop Consortium will reemerge as Airborn Audio. Their debut album is scheduled to drop on Ninja Tune Records, Feb. 2005.
